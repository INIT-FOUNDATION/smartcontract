We've compiled a series of tutorials designed to teach the basics of smart contracts and how to use them to consume data from the Chainlink oracle ecosystem. 

#Beginners

If you're new to smart contract development this is a great place to start. We walk you through developing your first smart contract that interacts with Chainlink.

Try out the [Beginners Tutorial](doc:beginners-tutorial).

# Intermediates

Randomness is very difficult to generate on blockchains. The reason for this is because every node must come to the same conclusion, forming a consensus. [Chainlink VRF](doc:chainlink-vrf) solves this by allowing smart contracts to consume random numbers.

Try out the [Intermediates Tutorial](doc:intermediates-tutorial) on consuming random numbers in smart contracts.
