We have a growing collection of pre-made Chainlinks, which will easily connect your smart contract to a specific API, giving your smart contract secure access to everything that API does. Additional Chainlinks can be built around existing APIs by their creators and/or individual developers by quickly making an [External Adapter](https://docs.chain.link/docs/external-adapters).

If you want additional security and reliability for your smart contract's triggering events, Chainlinkâ€™s decentralized oracle networks allow you to consume the same type of data from multiple data sources. By consuming data from multiple sources in this decentralized manner, your contract is able to have additional assurance that the data provided is indeed accurate.

If you haven't used a Chainlink before, see the [Request & Receive Data](doc:request-and-receive-data)  page for information specific to your network.

These oracles are set up on the Ethereum main network. You will need to send enough LINK to your requesting contract in order to create the Chainlink request.

If there are specific price data feeds that you need on-chain for your smart contract, let us know <a href="https://chainlinknodes.typeform.com/to/FJ9LZu" target="_blank">here</a>!
