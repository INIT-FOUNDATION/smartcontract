## Overview

This oracle checks Googleâ€™s DNS service to determine if a given domain is owned by a given blockchain address. Each address is stored in a _TXT record_.
This guide explains how to call the _DNS ownership oracle_ and verify that a given address owns a specific domain. For instance, we will confirm that the address _0xf75519f611776c22275474151a04183665b7feDe_ owns _www5.infernos.io_.  **Note** that the source of data is [google dns](https://dns.google/resolve?name=www5.infernos.io&type=TXT).

## Requirements

This guide assumes that you know how to create and deploy smart contracts on the Kovan Testnet using the following tools:

- [The Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- [Kovan Link tokens](/docs/link-token-contracts/#kovan-testnet)

Also you should be familiar with the [Chainlink Basic Request Model](/docs/architecture-request-model/).
If you are new to developing smart contracts on Ethereum, see the [Getting Started](/docs/conceptual-overview/) guide to learn the basics.

## DNS Ownership Contract

This example operates using the following steps:

1. When you deploy the contract, the `constructor()` initializes the address of `oracle` , the `jobId` and the fees `oraclePayment`. **Note** that these values are proper to _Kovan testnet_. Check the [Configuration section](#configuration) for other networks.
1. Run `requestProof()` to check that an address owns a domain name. For this example, you can use _www5.infernos.io_ for `_name` and _0xf75519f611776c22275474151a04183665b7feDe for `_record`. Notice how these parameters are used to build the Chainlink request. the selector of the `fulfill()` function is also passed so that the oracle knows which function to call back with the `proof`.
1. After few seconds, check the value of `proof`. It should return `true`.
