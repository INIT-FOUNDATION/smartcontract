## Keepers Supported Networks

Chainlink Keepers are currently available on the following networks:

- Ethereum:
  - [Mainnet](#ethereum-mainnet)
  - [Rinkeby Testnet](#ethereum-rinkeby-testnet)
  - [Kovan Testnet](#ethereum-kovan-testnet)
- Polygon (Matic):
  - [Mainnet](#polygon-mainnet)
  - [Mumbai Testnet](#polygon-mumbai-testnet)
- BNB Chain:
  - [Mainnet](#bnb-chain-mainnet)
  - [Testnet](#bnb-chain-testnet)
- Avalanche:
  - [Fuji Testnet](#avalanche-fuji-testnet)

If you are interested in using Keepers but need it on a different blockchain or network, [contact us](https://forms.gle/WadxnzzjHPtta5Zd9) and let us know.

These configurations may change as we grow our users and the network as a whole.

## Ethereum Mainnet

- **Payment Premium (paymentPremiumPPB):** <span>20</span>% gas premium
    This premium is applied on top of the gas cost paid by the Keeper to perform your Upkeep
- **Block Count Per Turn (blockCountPerTurn):** <span>10</span>
    The number of blocks in each turn before the Upkeep is rotated to the next Keeper
- **Check Gas Limit (checkGasLimit):** <span>6,500,000</span>
    The maximum amount of gas that can be used by your checkUpkeep for off-chain computation.
- **Call Gas Limit (callGasLimit):** <span>5,000,000</span>
    The maximum amount of gas that can be used by the client contract’s performUpkeep for the on-chain transaction. You can set an upper limit on your Upkeep during registration, but this number must not exceed the call gas limit on the KeeperRegistry.
