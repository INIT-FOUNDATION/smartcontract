We value the participation of each member of the community and want all participants to have an enjoyable experience. Accordingly, all participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other participants throughout the bootcamp. To make clear what is expected, all participants of this developer bootcamp are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.


#### **The Code**

The spirit of The Code is to prohibit activities including but not limited to:

    *   Physical or mental ability
    *   Age
    *   Socioeconomic status
    *   Ethnicity

*   Examples of other prohibited behaviors include, but are not limited to:
    *   Stalking
    *   Unwanted sexual attention
    *   Use of sexualized content

Participants asked to stop any behavior deemed as harassment are expected to comply immediately. If a participant fails to comply they will be asked to leave the event.

Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, Chainlink Labs staff and anyone else at the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should not use sexualized content in their projects or during the event.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the developer bootcamp organizers will take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expelling them from the event.

If you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct, please report it immediately to one of the event organizers or by emailing us at legal@chain.link. All reporters have the right to remain anonymous.
