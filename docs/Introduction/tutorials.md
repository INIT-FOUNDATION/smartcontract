Welcome to the smart contract beginner's guide. This guide provides a list of resources for people who want to understand how all of these different technologies work together, how to deploy smart contracts, and how Chainlink oracle networks provide off-chain data to smart contracts.

# Getting Started

Learn about smart contracts, the Solidity language, Chainlink oracles, and how they all fit together.

# Deploy Your First Smart Contract

Learn how to write, compile, deploy, and run your first smart contract in the [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org) language.

# Connect Contracts to Oracles

Oracles play an extremely important role in facilitating the full potential of smart contract utility. Without a reliable connection to real-world conditions, smart contracts are unable to effectively serve the real-world.

# Obtain Random Numbers for a Contract

Randomness is very difficult to generate on blockchains. The reason for this is because every node must come to the same conclusion, forming a consensus. [Chainlink VRF](../chainlink-vrf/) solves this by allowing smart contracts to obtain random numbers from an oracle network.

# Call Public APIs from a Smart Contract

Learn more about how the Chainlink Request and Receive cycle works under the hood, and how you can use this powerful software to feed data to your smart contracts.
