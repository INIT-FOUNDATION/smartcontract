  description: 'Run your own Chainlink node using this guide which explains the requirements and basics for getting started.'
---

This guide shows you how to run the Chainlink node in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Tagged Docker images are available from the [Chainlink Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/smartcontract/chainlink/tags). If you run Chainlink nodes in Docker, you don't need to configure a complete development environment to run your node.

If you need to run a Chainlink node from source, use the [install instructions](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink#install) in the Chainlink GitHub repository.

Nodes can fulfill requests for open APIs out-of-the-box using [Tasks](/docs/tasks/) without any additional configuration. If you need to provide data from an authenticated API, add an [external adapter](../external-adapters/) to enable connectivity through the Chainlink node.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/): This guide uses Docker containers to simplify dependencies and application deployment.
- Ethereum client: A fully synced Ethereum client with websockets enabled.
- Database: You must connect your Chainlink node to a database such as PostgreSQL.
- Network: Use Mainnet or a [supported testnet](/docs/link-token-contracts/).
- ETH and LINK: Mainnet or testnet funds that your node can use to fulfill requests

### Chainlink Node Requirements

Your Chainlink node should be run on a server that has a public IP address, and meets the following CPU and memory requirements:

- Minimum: To get started running a Chainlink node, you will need a machine with at least **2 cores** and **4 GB of RAM**.
- Recommended: The requirements for running a Chainlink node scale as the number of jobs your node services also scales. For nodes with over 100 jobs, you will need at least **4 cores** and **8GB of RAM**.

### PostgreSQL Database Requirements

In addition to running a Chainlink node, must also run a PostgreSQL database version 11 or newer on a system that meets the following CPU, memory, and storage requirements:

- Minimum: At least **2 cores**, **4GB of RAM**, and **100 GB of storage**.
- Recommended: To support more than 100 jobs, your database server will need at least **4 cores**, **16 GB of RAM**, and **100 GB of storage**.

Make sure that your DB host provides access to logs.

If you run your node on AWS, use an instance type with dedicated core time. [Burstable Performance Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/#Burstable_Performance_Instances) have a limited number of [CPU credits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-credits-baseline-concepts.html), so you should not use them to run Chainlink nodes that require consistent performance.

### LINK and ETH requirements

You can run a Chainlink node with 0 LINK, but the node will not be able to participate in requests that require a deposit until it has earned some LINK first. For testnets, you can get LINK from [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/).

You will need to send some ETH to your node's address in order for it to fulfill requests. You can view your node's ETH address when the node starts up or on the Configuration page of the GUI.

For a list of supported networks and available ETH and LINK faucets, see the [LINK Token Contracts](/docs/link-token-contracts/) page.

> ðŸ“˜ Running Chainlink Nodes on Ganache
>
> Ganache is a mock testnet. Although you can run nodes on Ganache, it is not officially supported. Most node operators should use one of the supported [testnets](/docs/link-token-contracts/) for development and testing.

## Configure Docker

Configure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) on the system where you plan to run your Chainlink node. Use the quick instructions for setting up Docker below:

  ```shell Amazon Linux 2
  sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y docker
  sudo systemctl start docker
  sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
  exit
  # log in again
  ```
  ```shell CentOS
  curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
  sudo systemctl start docker
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  exit
  # log in again
  ```
  ```shell Debian
  curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  exit
  # log in again
  ```
  ```shell Fedora
  curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
  sudo systemctl start docker
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  exit
  # log in again
  ```
  ```shell Ubuntu
  curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  exit
  # log in again
  ```

## Start an Ethereum Client

Connectivity to an Ethereum client is also required for communication with the blockchain. If you decide to run your own Ethereum client, you will want to run that on a separate machine. Hardware requirements of Ethereum clients can change over time. Alternatively, you can also use an [external service](/docs/run-an-ethereum-client/#external-services) as your Ethereum client.

  - [Run Geth](/docs/run-an-ethereum-client/#geth) with Goerli or Mainnet.
  - [Run Nethermind](/docs/run-an-ethereum-client/#nethermind)
  - [Use an external service](../run-an-ethereum-client/#external-services). You must have a valid URL and port number to connect your Chainlink node to an external service.

Be sure that your client is fully synced before you start your Chainlink node.

## Start a Database

Start a database that your Chainlink node can use to store data about the node and its processes. Either run the database on the same system as your Chainlink node, or connect your node to a remote database. To learn how to deploy and run PostgreSQL, use one of the following guides:

- [Run PostgreSQL locally in Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/)
- [Run PostgreSQL locally without Docker](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/server-start.html)
- [Connect to a remote database](../connecting-to-a-remote-database/)

After you start the database, use the default `postgres` user and `postgres` database or create a separate user and database for the Chainlink node. Record the username, the user password, and the database name that you configure. You'll provide this information in your Chainlink node's `.env` configuration file later.

## Configure the Chainlink Node

Create a new directory and an `.env` file with variables that tell your Chainlink node how to connect to your Ethereum client and your database.

1. [Create a directory](#create-a-directory)
1. [Create an Environment File](#create-an-environment-file)
1. [Set the Ethereum Client URL and Port](#set-the-ethereum-client-url-and-port)
1. [Set the Remote Database URL and Credentials](#set-the-remote-database-url-and-credentials)

### Create a directory

Create a local directory to hold the Chainlink Node data and `.env` configuration file. This guide creates a different directory depending on what network you plan to run:

```shell Goerli
mkdir ~/.chainlink-goerli && cd ~/.chainlink-goerli/
```
```shell Mainnet
mkdir ~/.chainlink && cd ~/.chainlink/
```

> **_Other Supported Networks:_** Chainlink is a blockchain-agnostic technology. The [LINK Token Contracts](/docs/link-token-contracts/) page details networks which support the LINK token. You can configure your node to operate on any of these blockchains.

### Create an Environment File

Use `echo` to create an `.env` environment file with the required variables for your specific network:

```shell Goerli
echo "ROOT=/chainlink
LOG_LEVEL=debug
ETH_CHAIN_ID=5
CHAINLINK_TLS_PORT=0
SECURE_COOKIES=false
ETH_URL=[PROTOCOL]://[CLIENT_ADDRESS]:[CLIENT_PORT]
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@[SERVER]:[PORT]/[DB_NAME]?sslmode=[SSL_MODE]
#DATABASE_TIMEOUT=0" > ~/.chainlink-goerli/.env
```
```shell Mainnet
echo "ROOT=/chainlink
LOG_LEVEL=debug
ETH_CHAIN_ID=1
CHAINLINK_TLS_PORT=0
SECURE_COOKIES=false
ETH_URL=[PROTOCOL]://[CLIENT_ADDRESS]:[CLIENT_PORT]
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@[SERVER]:[PORT]/[DB_NAME]?sslmode=[SSL_MODE]
ALLOW_ORIGINS=*" > ~/.chainlink/.env
```

If you need a complete list of available configuration variables for the node, see the [configuration variables](../configuration-variables/) page.

### Set the Ethereum Client URL and Port

Construct the URL for your Ethereum client and configure it in the `.env` file.

1. Find the hostname or IP address for your Ethereum client using one of the following methods:

    - If you are running the Ethereum client in a local Docker container, use the `docker inspect` command to find the IP address for that container:
      ```shell
      docker inspect --format '{{ "{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress " }}}}' $(docker ps -f name=eth -q)
      ```
    - If you are running the Ethereum client outside of a Docker container on your local system, use `localhost` as your address.
    - If you are running the Ethereum client on another server or from an external provider, find the DNS hostname or IP address for that system.

1. Find the port for your Ethereum client. The guide to [Run an Ethereum Client](../run-an-ethereum-client) sets `8546` as the port, but this number might be different depending on how you configured the client.

1. Open the `.env` file in a text editor.

1. In the editor, configure the `ETH_URL` variable with the address and port for your Ethereum client. The URL has the following structure:

    ```
    ETH_URL=[PROTOCOL]://[CLIENT_ADDRESS]:[CLIENT_PORT]
    ```

    - `[PROTOCOL]`: For local test clients, specify `ws` to use the unencrypted WebSocket protocol. For production clients and external providers, specify `wss` to use an SSL-encrypted WebSocket protocol. If you configure your own client and need `wss`, you might need to create an encrypted reverse proxy.
    - `[CLIENT_ADDRESS]`: The IP address or hostname that you obtained for your Ethereum client
    - `[CLIENT_PORT]`: The port for your Ethereum client. By default, Geth uses `8546` and Nethermind uses `8545`.

1. Save the `.env` file.

### Set the Remote Database URL and Credentials

Construct the address and credentials for your database and configure them in the `.env` file.

1. Find the address for your database using one of the following methods:

    - If you are running PostgreSQL in a local Docker container, use the `docker inspect` command to find the IP address for that container:

      ```shell
      docker inspect --format '{{ "{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress " }}}}' $(docker ps -f name=some-postgres -q)
      ```
    - If you are running PostgreSQL outside of a Docker container on your local system, use `localhost` as your address.
    - If you are running PostgreSQL on another server, find the DNS hostname or IP address for that system.

1. Find the port for your database. The guide to [Run PostgreSQL locally in Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) sets the default `5432` port, but this number might be different depending on how you configured the database.

1. Open the `.env` file in a text editor.

1. In the editor, configure the `DATABASE_URL` variable with the URL and credentials for your database. For PostgreSQL, the URL has the following structure:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@[SERVER]:[PORT]/[DB_NAME]?sslmode=[SSL_MODE]
    ```

    - `[USERNAME]`: The username for the database owner.
    - `[PASSWORD]`: The password for the database owner username.
    - `[SERVER]`: The hostname or IP address of the database server.
    - `[PORT]`: The port that the database is listening on. The default port is `5432`.
    - `[DB_NAME]`: The name of the database to use for the Chainlink node.
    - `[SSL_MODE]`: If you are testing on a database that does not have SSL enabled, specify `disable` so that you don't need to go through the process of configuring SSL on your database. On a production node, set this value to `require` or `verify-full` to require an encrypted connection between your Chainlink node and the database. See the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-PROTECTION) to learn about the available SSL modes.

1. Save the `.env` file.

## Start the Chainlink Node

After you configure the `.env` file, run the Docker image for the Chainlink node. Replace `$VERSION` with your desired node version. Tag versions are available in the [Chainlink docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/smartcontract/chainlink/tags). The `latest` version tag does not work.

```shell Goerli
cd ~/.chainlink-goerli && docker run -p 6688:6688 -v ~/.chainlink-goerli:/chainlink -it --env-file=.env smartcontract/chainlink:<version> local n
```
```shell Mainnet
cd ~/.chainlink && docker run -p 6688:6688 -v ~/.chainlink:/chainlink -it --env-file=.env smartcontract/chainlink:[VERSION] local n
```

> ðŸ“˜ Local Database
>
> If you are running a local database, you might need to add the `--network host` flag to the command above.

The first time you run the node, it will asks you for a password and confirmation. This will be your wallet password that you use to unlock the keystore file generated for you. Then, you are prompted to enter an API Email and Password. This will be used to expose the API for the GUI interface, and will be used every time you log into your node. When you run the node again, add the `-p` option with a path to a text file containing the wallet key password and also add the `-a` option pointing to a text file containing the API email and password. Instructions on how to do that are [here](../miscellaneous/#use-password-and-api-files-on-startup).

Find your node's ETH address when the node starts up or on the **Configuration** page of the GUI. You must send some ETH to your node's address in order for it to fulfill requests.

Connect to your Chainlink node's UI interface by navigating to [http://localhost:6688](http://localhost:6688). If your node is on a remote server, create an [SSH tunnel](https://www.howtogeek.com/168145/how-to-use-ssh-tunneling/) to your node for `6688:localhost:6688` to enable connectivity to the GUI. For example, you can run `ssh -i $KEY $USER@$REMOTE-IP -L 6688:localhost:6688 -N` to map your local port to the same port on the remote server. An SSH tunnel is preferred because it does not publicly expose ports for the Chainlink node. See the [Best Security and Operating Practices](../best-security-practices/) page for more details on how to secure your node.
