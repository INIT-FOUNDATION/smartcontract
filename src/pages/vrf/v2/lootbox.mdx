import { Aside } from "@components"
import { Tabs } from "@components/Tabs"

The lootbox is a utility contract that allow users to open it to receive a random reward.

It supports [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20), [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), and [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) tokens as rewards. The rewards are distributed from a pool of tokens that are trasferred to the contract on deploy.

The lootbox contract uses VRF to generate a random number that is used to determine the reward.

## Before you begin

Before you start this tutorial, complete the following items:

- Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - To check your installation, run `git --version`. You should see an output similar to `git version x.x.x`.
- Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) 16.0.0 or higher
  - To check your installation, run `node --version`. You should see an output similar to `v16.x.x`.
- Make sure the deployer account has enough LINK to fund the VRF subscription. If you don't already have a VRF subscription, the deployment script creates one for you.
  - Configure the initial funding amount in [`network-config.ts`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox/blob/main/network-config.ts).
  - For testnets, you can use the [LINK faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/).

1. Configure your deployment network in [`hardhat.config.ts`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts).

#### Contract parameters

In your `.env` file, fill in these values:

| Parameter                             | Description                                                                                                               | Example      |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `LOOTBOX_FEE_PER_OPEN`                | The fee per open in ETH                                                                                                   | `0.1`        |
| `LOOTBOX_AMOUNT_DISTRIBUTED_PER_OPEN` | The amount of reward units distributed per open                                                                           | `1`          |
| `LOOTBOX_OPEN_START_TIMESTAMP`        | The start timestamp in UNIX time for the public open. Leave blank to start immediately.                                   | `1630000000` |
| `VRF_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`                 | A funded Chainlink VRF subscription ID. If you leave this blank, a new subscription will be created and funded on deploy. | `123`        |

#### Reward tokens

The amounts per unit are used to calculate the lootbox supply of rewards. For example, if you want to distribute 100 tokens of a specific ERC20 token, you would set the `totalAmount` to `100000000000000000000` and the `amountPerUnit` to `1000000000000000000`. This would result in a lootbox supply of 100 units.

Add all the tokens you want to distribute as rewards to the array in the list of tokens by following the format below.

<Aside type="note">The deployer account must own all the tokens you want to distribute as rewards.</Aside>

There's an example configuration file in [`scripts/data/tokens.json`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox/blob/main/scripts/data/tokens.json) which includes a list of all supported token types:

  "tokenIds": ["1", "2"]
}
```

  "tokenId": "0",
  "totalAmount": "100",
  "amountPerUnit": "10"
}
```
</Fragment>
</Tabs>

#### Whitelist

The merkle tree for the private opening stage is generated from the address list in the [`scripts/data/whitelist.json`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox/blob/main/scripts/data/whitelist.json) file. Edit the file and add all the addresses you want to list.

Leave the file empty if you don't want to do a private mint and the contract will be initialized in public opening mode.

## Run steps

### Test

- To run the unit tests, run the following command:

  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

- If you want to see gas usage, run the following command:

  ```bash
  REPORT_GAS=true npm run test
  ```

- For coverage reports, run the following command:

  ```bash
  npm run coverage
  ```

### Deploy

To run the deploy script, run the following command and replace `<network>` with the network you want to deploy to.

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network>
```

<Aside type="note">
  The network must be configured in
  [`hardhat.config.ts`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts).
</Aside>

Besides deploying the contract, the [deploy script](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox/blob/main/scripts/deploy.ts) will also:

1.  Approve each token configured in [`scripts/data/tokens.json`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox/blob/main/scripts/data/tokens.json) for the deployed contract address.

    This is a mandatory step because the contract must store the tokens in its own balance. So make sure the deployer account owns all the tokens you want to distribute as rewards.

1.  Generate a merkle tree for the whitelist.

1.  Create and fund a VRF subscription if one is not provided.

    <Aside type="note">
Make sure the deployer account has enough LINK to fund the subscription. The initial funding amount is configured in [`network-config.ts`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox/blob/main/network-config.ts).

    For testnets, you can use the [LINK faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/).

    </Aside>

1.  Add the deployed contract address as a consumer to the VRF subscription.

    If you provided a subscription ID, make sure the deployer account is the owner of the subscription. Otherwise, comment out the `addVrfConsumer` function in the deploy script and add the contract address manually.

1.  Verify the contract on Etherscan. If you want to skip this step, comment out the `verify` function in the deploy script.

## Open the lootbox

Once the contract is deployed and the start timestamp is reached, users can start opening the lootbox. The amount of rewards they receive depends on the amount of units they open by specifying the `amountToOpen` parameter and paying the corresponding fee.

There are two modes for opening the lootbox which can be toggled by the owner account.

### Private mode

In this mode, the lootbox is only open to whitelisted addresses by calling the `privateOpen` function and providing merkle proof for the address. To generate it, see [merkletreejs](https://github.com/merkletreejs/merkletreejs).

The whitelist is set on contract deployment and can be changed by calling the `setWhitelistRoot` function from the owner account. The private mode can be enabled or disabled at any time by calling the `setPrivateOpen` function from the owner account.

### Public mode

When the private mode is disabled, anyone can open the lootbox by calling the `publicOpen` function. It will do the same thing as the `privateOpen` function but without the merkle proof.

## Randomness

The contract uses [Chainlink VRF](https://vrf.chain.link) to generate randomness which is used to determine the rewards the user receives.

Because the randomness is generated off-chain, the contract will not be able to transfer the rewards immediately. Instead, it will store the request and once the randomness is received, the user or anyone else can call the `claimRewards` function to transfer the rewards to the user.

The lootbox creator can also call the `claimRewards` function and improve the user experience by transferring the rewards to the user immediately. This can be further automated by using [Chainlink Automation](https://automation.chain.link/).

## Claim rewards

The rewards for an open request can be claimed by calling the `claimRewards` function and passing the opener address as the parameter. This will transfer the rewards to the opener address.

The claim function can only be called after the randomness is fulfilled. To check this, call the `canClaimRewards` function and pass the opener address as the parameter.

One address can only have one open request at a time. If you try to open the lootbox again before the previous request is fulfilled, the transaction will revert with `PendingOpenRequest` error.

## Withdraw funds

At any time, the owner can withdraw funds from the collected fees by calling the `withdraw` function. By doing so the contract balance will be transferred to the owner account.

## Post-deployment configuration

After deployment, you can change some contract parameters by calling the following functions from the owner account:

| Function           | Description                            | Parameters           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `setWhitelistRoot` | Set new merkle root for the whitelist. | `whitelistRoot`      |
| `setPrivateOpen`   | Enable/disable public opening mode.    | `privateOpenEnabled` |
