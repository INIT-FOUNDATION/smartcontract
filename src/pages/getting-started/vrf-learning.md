This guide introduces fundamental concepts, architecture models, best practices, and hands-on applications to help you get started building with Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function). If you're new to VRF, this is a great place to start. For experienced developers, we have resources and links to more advanced topics.

## What is Chainlink VRF?

**Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function)** is a provably fair and verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to access random values without compromising security or usability. For each request, Chainlink VRF generates one or more random values and cryptographic proof of how those values were determined. The proof is published and verified on-chain before any consuming applications can use it. This process ensures that results cannot be tampered with or manipulated by any single entity including oracle operators, miners, users, or smart contract developers. To read more about VRF, visit the [Chainlink VRF Documentation](/pages/any-api/introduction/).
