The key component in DeFi yield aggregators are the Vaults in which you stake your crypto tokens. The investment strategy tied to the specific vault will increase your deposited token amount by compounding arbitrary yield farm reward tokens back into your initially deposited asset. The process is called vault harvesting and can be automated by Chainlink Automation while making it more trustless and decentralized.

Below is the main contract `KeeperCompatibleHarvester.sol`.

<CodeSample src="" showButtonOnly />

This is an abstract contract that iterates vaults from a provided list and fits vaults within upkeep gas limit. The contract also provides helper functions to calculate gas consumption and estimate profit and contains a trigger mechanism can be time-based, profit-based or custom. Finally, the cotract reports profits, successful harvests, and failed harvests.
