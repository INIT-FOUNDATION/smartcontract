Using [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/introduction/) in generative art NFT collections is de-facto the standard approach for getting provably random source in smart contracts. By batching the reveal process, instead of making VRF calls for each NFT we can save cost up to 100x (in a collection of 10,000 with batch size of 100).

This template uses the [Chainlink Automation](https://automation.chain.link) decentralized network to automate the reveal process so you don't have to stand up and maintain an inhouse system for automation.

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will use a [demo user interface](https://automation.chainlink-demo.app) to learn how to use Chainlink Automation to automate batch reveal of NFT mints. The demo includes setting up a Chainlink VRF subscription, funding it, automatically generating a smart contract that will then be used by both VRF (as a consumer) and in Automation (as the target contract). VRF is used for randomizing the metadata for the NFTs and Automation is used to set trigger conditions for when the NFT metadata is revealed via batch size and/or time interval parameters

## Before you begin

Before you start this tutorial, complete the following items:

- Set up a cryptocurrency wallet
- To deploy this contract on testnets, ensure the deployer account has testnet ERC-677 LINK. Use the [LINK faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/) to retrieve testnet LINK.

## Run steps

1. Go to the [demo app](https://automation.chainlink-demo.app/) and connect to your wallet with the right network. Then click on the **Get Started** button.

1. Enter the basic information regarding your NFT collection. The tool tips on the demo app explain what each field is. Notice that you'll need a VRF Subscription ID.

1. At this stage, you will need to create a VRF subscription and fund it with LINK by visiting the [Chainlink VRF Subscription Manager](https://vrf.chain.link/). Follow the steps outlined in the interface to create a subscription.

1. Add funds to yout subscription. Copy the resulting subscription ID to your clipboard.
