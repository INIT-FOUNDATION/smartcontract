This guide employs [Starknet Devnet RS](https://github.com/0xSpaceShard/starknet-devnet-rs), a local Docker-based testnet environment for Starknet. It provides code examples and scripts that enable you to compile, declare, and deploy your own aggregator and consumer contracts. You can use a set of pre-funded accounts to interact with Chainlink Data Feeds on Starknet without deploying to a live network.

## Requirements

### Set up your environment

This guide uses the [Starknet Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry) toolkit and the [Scarb](https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb) project management tool so you can compile, deploy, and interact with your Starknet smart contracts.

- **Starknet Foundry**: Make sure you have Starknet Foundry **v0.20.1** installed. You can check your current version by running <CopyText text="snforge --version" code/> or <CopyText text="sncast --version" code/> in your terminal and [install the required version](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry#installation) if necessary.

- **Scarb**: Make sure you have Scarb **v2.5.4** installed. You can check your current version by running <CopyText text="scarb --version" code/> in your terminal and [install the required version](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-installation-script) if necessary.

Alternatively, you can use the [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/introduction.html) tool version manager to install both Starknet Foundry and Scarb. Read the setup instructions for [Starknet Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/asdf-starknet-foundry) and [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-asdf) for more information.

- **Docker**: Make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed. You will run Starknet Devnet RS in a Docker container.

### Clone and configure the code examples repository

1. Clone the [chainlink-starknet](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/) repository, which includes the example contracts for this guide:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the `aggregator_consumer` [LINK_TO_UPDATE] directory:

   ```bash
   cd chainlink-starknet/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/
   ```

1. In the `~/chainlink-starknet/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/` directory, make sure the `url` property in your `snfoundry.toml` file points to the Docker container. For example:

   ```bash
   [sncast.default]
   url = "http://127.0.0.1:5050/rpc"
   ```

After you prepare the requirements, check to make sure the required tools are configured correctly by running the tests:

    ```bash
    snforge test
    ```

The contracts should compile successfully and the tests should pass.
