This example reads the aggregator proxy contract to get the latest values with no account or contract compiling steps required. The [TO_UPDATE] script makes a call directly to the data feed proxy address. By default, the script reads the ETH / USD feed, but you can change the address to read any of the [available data feeds](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=starknet) on the Starknet Sepolia testnet.

## Requirements

### Set up your environment

This guide uses the [Starknet Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry) toolkit and the [Scarb](https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb) project management tool so you can compile, deploy, and interact with your Starknet smart contracts.

- **Starknet Foundry**: Make sure you have Starknet Foundry **v0.20.1** installed. You can check your current version by running <CopyText text="snforge --version" code/> or <CopyText text="sncast --version" code/> in your terminal and [install the required version](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry#installation) if necessary.

- **Scarb**: Make sure you have Scarb **v2.5.4** installed. You can check your current version by running <CopyText text="scarb --version" code/> in your terminal and [install the required version](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-installation-script) if necessary.

Alternatively, you can use the [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/introduction.html) tool version manager to install both Starknet Foundry and Scarb. Read the setup instructions for [Starknet Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/asdf-starknet-foundry) and [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-asdf) for more information.

### Clone and configure the code examples repository

1. Clone the [chainlink-starknet](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/) repository, which includes the example contracts and script for this guide:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the `aggregator_consumer` [LINK_TO_UPDATE] directory:

   ```bash
   cd chainlink-starknet/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/
   ```

1. In the `~/chainlink-starknet/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/` directory, make sure the `url` property in your `snfoundry.toml` file points to a Starknet Sepolia RPC endpoint. For example:

   ```bash
   [sncast.default]
   url = "https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_7"
   ```

   Note: This example utilizes a [Blast API](https://blastapi.io/public-api/starknet) RPC endpoint. You can interact with the network using any other Starknet Sepolia RPC provider, such as [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/starknet) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/networks/ethereum/starknet).

## Tutorial

In the `~/chainlink-starknet/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/` directory, run the [TO_UPDATE] script:

```bash
make [TO_UPDATE]
```

The script reads the latest data from the ETH / USD Chainlink data feed proxy contract and prints it. Expect an output similar to the following:

```bash
Compiling lib(src) src v0.1.0 (~/chainlink-starknet/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/scripts/Scarb.toml)
Compiling starknet-contract(src) src v0.1.0 (~/chainlink-starknet/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/scripts/Scarb.toml)
Finished release target(s) in 9 seconds
Result::Ok(CallResult { data: [TO_UPDATE] })
command: script run
status: success
```

The output contains an array with the latest data from the Chainlink data feed proxy contract. The array contains the following values:

| Value name   | Example value | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `round_id`   | `TO_UPDATE`   | The unique identifier of the round of data updates.                                                               |
| `answer`     | `TO_UPDATE`   | The actual data provided by the data feed, representing the latest price of an asset in the case of a price feed. |
| `block_num`  | `TO_UPDATE`   | The block number at which the data was recorded on the blockchain.                                                |
| `started_at` | `TO_UPDATE`   | The timestamp indicating when the data round started, represented as a Unix timestamp.                            |
| `updated_at` | `TO_UPDATE`   | The timestamp indicating when the data was last updated, represented as a Unix timestamp.                         |
