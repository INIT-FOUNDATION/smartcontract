<DataStreams section="streamsDirectEarlyAccess" />

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Chainlink Data Streams with the [Streams Direct](/data-streams#streams-direct-using-the-data-engine-with-your-own-bot) implementation and the [RESTful API](/data-streams/reference/streams-direct-interface-api) to fetch reports from the Data Engine. You'll set up your Go project, retrieve reports from the API, decode them, and log their attributes to your terminal.

<DataStreams section="asideDisclaimer" />

## Before you begin

- **Go Version**: Make sure you have Go version 1.21 or higher. You can check your current version by running `go version` in your terminal and download the latest version from the official [Go website](https://go.dev/) if necessary.
- **API Credentials**: Access to the Streams Direct implementation requires API credentials. If you haven't already, [contact us](https://chainlinkcommunity.typeform.com/datastreams?#ref_id=docs) to talk to an expert about integrating Chainlink Data Streams with your applications.

## Tutorial

You'll start with the set up of your Go project. Next, you'll fetch and decode reports for both single and multiple feeds, and log their attributes to your terminal.

### Set up your Go project

1.  Create and navigate to your project directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir data-streams-direct && cd data-streams-direct
    ```

1.  Initialize a Go module:

    ```bash
    go mod init data-streams-direct
    ```

1.  Open the `go.mod` file at the root of your project directory and include the necessary module and package information:

    <CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/StreamsDirect/mod.go" />

1.  Create `client` and `internal` subfolders within your project directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir client internal
    ```

1.  Create a `client.go` file in the `client` subfolder and a `decoder.go` file in the `internal` subfolder:

    ```bash
    touch client/client.go
    touch internal/decoder.go
    ```

1.  Insert the provided code into `client.go` and `decoder.go` to enable your application to fetch and decode reports:

        <Tabs sharedStore="package" client:visible>
        <Fragment slot="tab.1">client/client.go</Fragment>
        <Fragment slot="tab.2">internal/decoder.go</Fragment>
        <Fragment slot="panel.1">
            <CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/StreamsDirect/client.go" />
        </Fragment>
        <Fragment slot="panel.2">
            <CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/StreamsDirect/decoder.go" />
        </Fragment>
        </Tabs>

1.  Execute the command below to download dependencies and generate the `go.sum` file:

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

    Your project directory should now have the following structure:

    ```plaintext
    data-streams-direct/
    ├── client/
    │   └── client.go
    ├── go.mod
    ├── go.sum
    ├── internal/
    │   └── decoder.go
    ```

### Set environment variables

Set the required environment variables in your terminal session to authenticate with the Data Engine API:

    ```bash
    export BASE_URL='api.testnet-dataengine.chain.link'
    export CLIENT_ID='YOUR_CLIENT_ID'
    export CLIENT_SECRET='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
    ```

    - `BASE_URL` is the REST endpoint to poll for specific reports. See the [Streams Direct Interface](/data-streams/reference/streams-direct-interface-api#domains) guide for more information.
    - Replace `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` with your API credentials.

### Fetch and decode a report with a single feed

1.  Create `singleFeed.go` at the root of your project directory:

    ```bash
    touch singleFeed.go
    ```

    Then, open `singleFeed.go` and insert the following code to fetch and decode a single feed:

    <CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/StreamsDirect/singleFeed.go" />

1.  Execute your application:

    ```bash
    go run singleFeed.go
    ```

    Expect output similar to the following in your terminal:

        ```plaintext
        Generating HMAC with the following:  GET /api/v1/reports?feedID=0x00027bbaff688c906a3e20a34fe951715d1018d262a5b66e38eda027a674cd1b&timestamp=1707920277 e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 <YOUR_CLIENT_ID> 1707920278120

#### Decoded report details

The report in this example uses the [Basic schema](/data-streams/reference/report-schema#basic-schema) and is decoded with the corresponding `V2Report` library.

### Fetch and decode a report with multiple feeds

1.  Create a `multipleFeeds.go` file at the root of your project directory:

    ```bash
    touch multipleFeeds.go
    ```

    Then, open the `multipleFeeds.go` file and insert the following code to fetch and decode multiple feeds:

    <CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/StreamsDirect/multipleFeeds.go" />

1.  Ensure the required environment variables are still defined in your terminal session.

    ```bash
    echo $BASE_URL
    echo $CLIENT_ID
    echo $CLIENT_SECRET
    ```

    Otherwise, [set them](/data-streams/tutorials/streams-direct-api#set-environment-variables) again.

1.  Run your application:

    ```bash
    go run multipleFeeds.go
    ```

    Expect to see the output below in your terminal:

        ``` plaintext

        Your application has successfully fetched and decoded data for both feeds from the same report.

<DataStreams section="asideOnChainVerification" />

## Explanation

### Fetching a report

The application fetches a report from the Data Engine API using either the `FetchSingleReportSingleFeed` function for a single feed or the `FetchSingleReportMultipleFeeds` function for multiple feeds, found in the `client` package. This step involves sending an API request and receiving a response with the report data in either a `SingleReport` struct (single feed) or a `BulkReportResponse` struct (multiple feeds).

The response includes a `FullReport` blob containing the encoded report's context and observations.

### Decoding a report

When the application successfully fetches the report, it decodes the report with the `DecodeFullReportAndReportData` function from the `internal` package. The process includes:

1. **`FullReport` blob decoding**: It first decodes the `FullReport` blob into a `FullReport` struct, extracting the report context (including the feed ID(s) and the report version) and the report data. In this example, the feed uses the [Basic Schema](/data-streams/reference/report-schema#basic-schema), corresponding to the `V2` report version.

1. **Report data decoding**: Based on the feed ID(s) version(s), it transforms the raw data into a structured format. In this example, the application decodes the report data into a `V2Report` struct, which contains the report's attributes.

### Handling the decoded data

The application logs the structured report data to the terminal. However, this data can be used for further processing, analysis, or display in your own application.
