In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use the [Streams Direct](/data-streams#streams-direct-using-the-data-engine-with-your-own-bot) implementation of Chainlink Data Streams to fetch and decode reports from the RESTful API using Go. You'll set up your Go project, retrieve reports from the API, and decode them.

## Before you begin

- Ensure you have Go version 1.21 or higher. You can download it from the official [Go website](https://go.dev/) and verify your version with the `go version` command in your terminal.
- Access to the Streams Direct implementation requires API credentials. [Contact us](https://chainlinkcommunity.typeform.com/datastreams?#ref_id=docs) to talk to an expert about integrating Chainlink Data Streams with your applications if you don't have credentials yet.

## Tutorial

You'll start with the set up of your Go project. Next, you'll fetch and decode reports for both single and multiple feeds, and log their attributes to your terminal.

### Set up your Go project

1.  Create and navigate to your project directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir data-streams-direct && cd data-streams-direct
    ```

1.  Initialize a Go module:

    ```bash
    go mod init data-streams-direct
    ```

1.  Define the required environment variables in your terminal session:

    ```bash
    export BASE_URL='api.testnet-dataengine.chain.link'
    export CLIENT_ID='YOUR_CLIENT_ID'
    export CLIENT_SECRET='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
    ```

    - `BASE_URL` is the Data Engine API URL. See the [Streams Direct Interface guide](/data-streams/reference/streams-direct-interface#domains) for more information.
    - `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` are your API credentials.

1.  Open the `go.mod` file at the root of your project directory and include the necessary module and package information:

    <CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/StreamsDirect/mod.go" />

1.  Create `client` and `internal` subfolders within your project directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir client internal
    ```

1.  Create a `client.go` file in the `client` subfolder:

    ```bash
    touch client/client.go
    ```

    Open the `client.go` file and insert the following code to enable report fetching:

    <CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/StreamsDirect/client.go" />

1.  Create a `decoder.go` file in the `internal` subfolder:

    ```bash
    touch internal/decoder.go
    ```

    Open the `decoder.go` file and insert the following code to enable report decoding:

    <CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/StreamsDirect/decoder.go" />

1.  Execute the command below to download dependencies and generate the `go.sum` file:

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

    Your project directory should now have the following structure:

    ```plaintext
    data-streams-direct/
    ├── client/
    │   └── client.go
    ├── go.mod
    ├── go.sum
    ├── internal/
    │   └── decoder.go
    ```

### Fetch and decode a report with a single feed

1.  Create a `singleFeed.go` file at the root of your project directory:

    ```bash
    touch singleFeed.go
    ```

    Then, open the `singleFeed.go` file and insert the following code to initialize the fetching and decoding processes for a single feed:

    <CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/StreamsDirect/singleFeed.go" />

1.  Run your application:

    ```bash
    go run singleFeed.go
    ```

    Expect to see the output below in your terminal:

        ```plaintext
        Generating HMAC with the following:  GET /api/v1/reports?feedID=0x00027bbaff688c906a3e20a34fe951715d1018d262a5b66e38eda027a674cd1b&timestamp=1707920277 e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 <YOUR_CLIENT_ID> 1707920278120

This tutorial logs data to the terminal, but you can also utilize these attributes for further analysis, processing, or display in your application.

### Fetch and decode a report with multiple feeds

1.  Create a `multipleFeeds.go` file at the root of your project directory:

    ```bash
    touch multipleFeeds.go
    ```

    Then, open the `multipleFeeds.go` file and insert the following code to initialize the fetching and decoding processes for a multiple feeds:

    <CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/StreamsDirect/multipleFeeds.go" />

1.  Run your application:

    ```bash
    go run multipleFeeds.go
    ```

        Your application has successfully fetched and decoded data for both feeds from the same report.

This tutorial logs data to the terminal, but you can also utilize these attributes for further analysis, processing, or display in your application.

## Explanation

### Fetching the report

The application fetches a report from the Data Engine API using either the `FetchSingleReportSingleFeed` function for a single feed or the `FetchSingleReportMultipleFeeds` function for multiple feeds, found in the `client` package. This step involves sending an API request and receiving a response with the report data in either a `SingleReport` struct (single feed) or a `BulkReportResponse` struct (multiple feeds).

The response includes a `FullReport` blob containing the encoded report's context and observations.

### Decoding the report

When the application successfully fetches the report, it decodes the report with the `DecodeFullReportAndReportData` function from the `internal` package. The process includes:

1. **`FullReport` blob decoding**: It first decodes the `FullReport` blob into a `FullReport` struct, extracting the report context (including the feed ID(s) and the report version) and the report data.

1. **Report data decoding**: Based on the feed ID(s) version(s), it transforms the raw data into a structured format.

### Handling the decoded data

The application then logs the decoded data to the terminal. This data can be used for further processing, analysis, or display in your own application.
