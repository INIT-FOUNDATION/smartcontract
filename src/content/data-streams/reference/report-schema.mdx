Data Streams can deliver a broad array of information in each report. The values you can expect in each report depend on the schema for the Stream ID that you select. You can find the schema for each ID on the [Stream IDs](/data-streams/stream-ids) page.

## Basic schema

Streams with the `Basic` schema have the following values specifically applicable to market pricing data:

- `feedID`: The unique identifier for the stream
- `validFromTimestamp`: The earliest timestamp during which the price is valid
- `observationsTimestamp`: The latest timestamp during which the price is valid
- `nativeFee`: The cost to verify this report when paying with the blockchain's native token
- `linkFee`: The cost to verify this report when paying with LINK
- `expiresAt`: The expiration date of this report
- `price`: The DON's concensus median price for this report carried to 8 decimal places

## Premium schema

The `Premium` schema includes all values from the `Basic` schema, and also includes `bid` and `ask` values:

- `bid`: The simulated price impact of a buy order up to the X% depth of liquidity usage
- `ask`: Simulated price impact of a sell order up to the X% depth of liquidity usage
