Streams Direct requires several interfaces in order to verify data onchain.

The primary onchain interaction occurs between the `IVerifierProxy` interface and your protocol's client contract. Find the Verifier proxy address of each stream ID on the [Stream IDs](/data-streams/stream-ids) page.

## Interfaces and contract example

- IVerifierProxy
- IFeeManager

In the current code example for verifying reports onchain using Streams Direct, these interfaces are specified in the example itself. Imports for these interfaces will be available in the future.
