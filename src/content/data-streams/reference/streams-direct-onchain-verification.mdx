<Aside type="caution" title="Onchain Data Verification">
  Onchain verification ensures the integrity of reports by confirming their authenticity as signed by the Decentralized
  Oracle Network (DON). It is the responsibility of the application contract(s) to determine the suitability of the
  report data for any further actions, such as trade execution.
</Aside>

Streams Direct requires several interfaces in order to verify data onchain.

The primary onchain interaction occurs between the `IVerifierProxy` interface and your protocol's client contract. Find the Verifier proxy address for each stream ID on the [Stream IDs](/data-streams/stream-ids) page.

## Interfaces and contract example

- IVerifierProxy
- IFeeManager

In the current code example for verifying reports onchain using Streams Direct, these interfaces are specified in the example itself. Imports for these interfaces will be available in the future.

### Contract example to Verify Data Onchain

This contract example allows you to verify reports, paying for the verification fee in LINK tokens. Learn how to [fund your contract with LINK tokens](/resources/fund-your-contract).
