  - Chainlink Functions contracts are part of the [@chainlink/contracts npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts). Read the [FunctionsClient](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-client) and [FunctionsRequest](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-request) API references.
  - Use the [Functions npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/functions-toolkit) in your own JavaScript or TypeScript project to make requests to the Chainlink Functions Decentralized Oracle Network (DON). Try the [getting-started guide](/chainlink-functions/getting-started) to learn more.
