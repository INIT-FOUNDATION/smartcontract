<Aside type="note" title="Explore Chainlink Functions Playground">
  Start exploring Chainlink Functions in your browser using the [Chainlink Functions
  Playground](https://functions.chain.link/playground). You can use the playground to simulate Chainlink Functions, call
  APIs, and execute demo requests.
</Aside>

Learn how to integrate the [Chainlink Functions NPM package](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-toolkit) to your own JavaScript or TypeScript project, then make requests to the Chainlink Functions Decentralized Oracle Network (DON). Chainlink Functions is available on several blockchains (see the [supported networks page](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks)), but this guide uses Polygon Mumbai to simplify access to testnet funds. Complete the following tasks to get started with Chainlink Functions:

- Set up your Web3 wallet and find your private key.
- Install the required frameworks.
- Configure your project with your environment variables.
- Simulate a Chainlink Functions request on your local machine.
- Send a Chainlink Functions request to the DON.

## Example

This guide shows you how to:

- Send a JavaScript source code from your smart contract to Chainlink Functions. The JavaScript source code makes an API call to the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) and fetches the name of a given character.
- Receive the response from Chainlink Functions and parse the result.

Read the [Examine the code](#examine-the-code) section for a detailed explanation of the code example.

### Simulation

Before making a Chainlink Functions request from your smart contract, it is always a good practice to simulate the source code off-chain to make any adjustments or corrections.

1. Open the [Functions playground](https://functions.chain.link/playground).
1. Copy and paste the following source code into the playground's code block.

   <CodeSample lang="javascript" src="samples/ChainlinkFunctions/starwars-api.js" />

1. Under _Argument_, set the first argument to <CopyText text="1" code/>. You are going to fetch the name of the first Star Wars character.
1. Click on _Run code_. Under _Output_, you should see _Luke Skywalker_.

### Configure your resources

#### Configure your wallet

You will test on Polygon Mumbai, so you must have an Ethereum web3 wallet with enough MATIC and LINK tokens. MATIC is the native gas fee token on Polygon. You will use MATIC tokens to pay for gas whenever you make a transaction on Polygon Mumbai. On the other hand, you will use LINK tokens to pay the Chainlink Functions Decentralized Oracles Network (DON) for processing your request.

1. [Install the MetaMask wallet](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract#install-and-fund-your-metamask-wallet) or other Ethereum web3 wallet.

1. Set the network for your wallet to the Polygon Mumbai testnet. If you need to add Mumbai to your wallet, you can find the chain ID and the LINK token contract address on the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts#mumbai-testnet) page.

   - <a
       class="erc-token-address"
       id="80001_0x326C977E6efc84E512bB9C30f76E30c160eD06FB"
       href="/resources/link-token-contracts#mumbai-testnet"
     >
       Polygon Mumbai testnet and LINK token contract
     </a>

1. Request testnet MATIC from the [Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).

1. Request testnet LINK from [faucets.chain.link/mumbai](https://faucets.chain.link/mumbai).

#### Deploy a Functions consumer contract on _Polygon Mumbai_

1. [Open the GettingStartedFunctionsConsumer.sol contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/ChainlinkFunctions/GettingStartedFunctionsConsumer.sol) in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/ChainlinkFunctions/GettingStartedFunctionsConsumer.sol" showButtonOnly={true} />

1. Compile the contract.
1. Open MetaMask and select the _Polygon Mumbai_ network.
1. In Remix under the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ in the **Environment** list. Remix will use the MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Polygon Mumbai_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/chainlink-functions/getting-started/injected-provider.jpg" />

1. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy the contract. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Check the transaction details to make sure you are deploying the contract to _Polygon Mumbai_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/chainlink-functions/getting-started/deploy.jpg" />

1. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears in the **Deployed Contracts** list. Copy the contract address.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/chainlink-functions/getting-started/deployed-contracts.jpg" />

#### Create a subscription

Follow the [Managing Functions Subscriptions](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#create-a-subscription) guide to accept the Chainlink Functions Terms of Service (ToS), create a subscription, fund it, then add your consumer contract address to it.

You can find the Chainlink Functions UI at [functions.chain.link](https://functions.chain.link/).

### Run the example

The example is hardcoded to communicate with Chainlink Functions on Polygon Mumbai. Read the [Examine the code](#examine-the-code) section for a detailed description of all components.

To run the example:

1.  In Remix under the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, expand your contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section.
1.  Expand the `sendRequest` function to display its parameters.
1.  Fill in the `subscriptionId` with your subscription ID and `args` with `[1]`.
    <ClickToZoom src="/images/chainlink-functions/getting-started/send-request.jpg" />
1.  Wait for the request to be fulfilled. You can monitor the status of your request on the Chainlink Functions frontend.
    <ClickToZoom src="/images/chainlink-functions/getting-started/request-fulfilled.jpg" />
1.  Once the status is _Success_, check the character name: In Remix, under the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, click on the `character` function, and you'll get the name of your character.
    <ClickToZoom src="/images/chainlink-functions/getting-started/character.jpg" />

Chainlink Functions is capable of much more than just computation. Try one of the [Tutorials](/chainlink-functions/tutorials) to see examples that can GET and POST to public APIs, securely handle API secrets, handle custom responses, and query multiple APIs.
