<Aside type="caution" title="Deprecation Notice for CCIP v1.0.0 on Testnet">
  CCIP v1.0.0 has been deprecated on testnet. Users must use the new router addresses mentioned in the [CCIP v1.2.0
  configuration page](/ccip/supported-networks/v1_2_0/testnet) **before January 31st, 2024**. Please note that there is
  no change to the router interface. The CCIP v1.0 testnet routers will continue to function in parallel **until January
  31st, 2024**, but we highly recommend switching to the v1.2 routers as soon as possible.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Testnet tokens">
  Read the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts?parent=ccip) page to learn where to get testnet LINK
  and native gas tokens. You can pay fees for each network in native gas tokens, wrapped native gas tokens, or LINK
  tokens.
