title: "CCIP Cross-chain tokens"
---

These tutorials focus on transferring tokens across chains, and some tutorials show how to transfer both tokens and data across chains.

## Tutorials

- [Transfer Tokens](/ccip/tutorials/cross-chain-tokens): Learn how to transfer tokens between smart contracts across different blockchains, using Chainlink CCIP.
- [Transfer Tokens with Data](/ccip/tutorials/programmable-token-transfers): Learn how to transfer tokens and arbitrary data between smart contracts on different blockchains.
- [Transfer Tokens with Data - Defensive Example](/ccip/tutorials/programmable-token-transfers-defensive): Learn how to do programmable token transfers and use defensive coding in the receiver contract.
- [Transfer USDC with Data](/ccip/tutorials/usdc): Learn how to transfer USDC and arbitrary data between smart contracts across different blockchains.
