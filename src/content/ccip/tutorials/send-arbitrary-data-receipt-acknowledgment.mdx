This tutorial will teach you how to use Chainlink CCIP to send arbitrary data between smart contracts on different blockchains and how to track the status of each sent message in the sender contract on the source chain. This tracking enables the execution of actions once the sender receives an acknowledgment of receipt from the receiver. In this tutorial, the sender contract will emit an event upon reception of the acknowledgment of receipt.

**Note**: For simplicity, this tutorial demonstrates this pattern for sending arbitrary data. However, you are not limited to this application. You can apply the same pattern to programmable token transfers.

## Before you begin

- This tutorial assumes you have completed the [Send Arbitrary Data](/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data) tutorial.
- Your account must have some ETH tokens on _Ethereum Sepolia_ and MATIC tokens on _Polygon Mumbai_.
- Learn how to [Acquire testnet LINK](/resources/acquire-link) and [Fund your contract with LINK](/resources/fund-your-contract).

## Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will deploy a _message tracker_ contract on the source blockchain (Ethereum Sepolia) and an _acknowledger_ on the destination blockchain (Polygon Mumbai). Throughout the tutorial, you will pay for CCIP fees using LINK tokens. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Sending and building a CCIP message:** You'll initiate and send a message from the _message tracker_ contract on Ethereum Sepolia to the _acknowledger_ contract on Polygon Mumbai. The _message tracker_ contract constructs a CCIP message that encapsulates a string text and establishes a tracking status for this message before sending it off.
1. **Receiving and acknowledging the message:** Upon receiving the text, the _acknowledger_ contract on Polygon Mumbai sends back a CCIP message to the _message tracker_ contract as an acknowledgment of receipt.
1. **Updating tracking status:** Once the acknowledgment is received, the _message tracker_ contract updates the tracking status of the initial CCIP message and emits an event to signal completion.

### Deploy the _message tracker_ (sender) contract

Deploy the `MessageTracker.sol` contract on _Ethereum Sepolia_ and enable receiving messages from and sending messages to _Polygon Mumbai_. You must also allow the _acknowledger_ contract address as a sender.

1. [Open the MessageTracker.sol contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/MessageTracker.sol) in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/MessageTracker.sol" />

1. Compile the contract.

1. Deploy the contract on _Ethereum Sepolia_:

   1. Open MetaMask and select the _Ethereum Sepolia_ network.
   1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ in the **Environment** list. Remix will use the MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Ethereum Sepolia_.
   1. Under the **Deploy** section, fill in the router address and the LINK token contract address for your specific blockchain. You can find both of these addresses on the [Supported Networks](/ccip/supported-networks) page. The LINK token contract address is also listed on the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts) page. For _Ethereum Sepolia_:

      - The router address is <CopyText text="0x0bf3de8c5d3e8a2b34d2beeb17abfcebaf363a59" code/>
      - The LINK address is <CopyText text="0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789" code/>

        alt="Chainlink CCIP - Fund Deployed Message Tracker Sepolia"
        style="max-width: 70%;"
      />

1. As the _message tracker_ contract will send messages to and receive messages from the _acknowledger_ contract deployed on _Polygon Mumbai_, you must allow the _Polygon Mumbai_ chain selector in both _message tracker_'s allowed destination and source chains.

   1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, expand the _message tracker_ contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section.
   1. Call the `allowlistDestinationChain` function with <CopyText text="12532609583862916517" code/> as the destination chain selector for _Polygon Mumbai_ and <CopyText text="true" code /> as allowed.
   1. Call the `allowlistSourceChain` function with <CopyText text="12532609583862916517" code/> as the source chain selector for _Polygon Mumbai_ and <CopyText text="true" code /> as allowed.
      You can find each network's chain selector on the [ supported networks page ](/ccip/supported-networks).

        style="max-width: 70%;"
      />

### Deploy the acknowledger (receiver) contract

Deploy the `Acknowledger.sol` contract on _Polygon Mumbai_ and enable receiving messages from and sending messages to _Ethereum Sepolia_. You must also allow the _message tracker_ contract address as a sender.

1.  [Open the Acknowledger.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/Acknowledger.sol) contract in Remix.

    <CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/Acknowledger.sol" />

1.  Compile the contract.

1.  Deploy the contract on _Polygon Mumbai_:

    1. Open MetaMask and select the _Polygon Mumbai_ network.

    1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, make sure the **Environment** is still set to _Injected Provider - MetaMask_.
    1. Under the **Deploy** section, fill in the router address and the LINK token contract address for your specific blockchain. You can find both of these addresses on the [Supported Networks](/ccip/supported-networks) page. The LINK token contract address is also listed on the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts) page. For _Polygon Mumbai_:

       - The Router address is <CopyText text="0x1035cabc275068e0f4b745a29cedf38e13af41b1" code/>.
       - The LINK token address is <CopyText text="0x326C977E6efc84E512bB9C30f76E30c160eD06FB" code/>.

         alt="Chainlink CCIP - Deployed Acknowledger Mumbai"
         style="max-width: 70%;"
       />

    1. Open MetaMask and send <CopyText text="1" code/> LINK to the contract address that you copied. Your contract will pay CCIP fees in LINK.

       <ClickToZoom
         src="/images/ccip/tutorials/fund-deployed-acknowledger-sepolia.webp"
         alt="Chainlink CCIP - Fund Deployed Acknowledger Mumbai"
         style="max-width: 70%;"
       />

1.  As the _acknowledger_ contract will send messages to and receive messages from the _message tracker_ contract deployed on _Ethereum Sepolia_, you must allow the _Ethereum Sepolia_ chain selector in both _acknowledger_'s allowed destination and source chains. You must also allow the _message tracker_ contract address as a sender. The _message tracker_ contract address is the address you copied when you deployed the _message tracker_ contract on _Ethereum Sepolia_.

    1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, expand the _acknowledger_ contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section. Expand the `allowlistDestinationChain`, `allowlistSender`, and `allowlistSourceChain` functions and fill in the following arguments:

       | Function                  | Description                                                                                                                                             | Value (_Ethereum Sepolia_)                                                 |
       | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
       | allowlistDestinationChain | CCIP Chain identifier of the target blockchain. You can find each network's chain selector on the [ supported networks page ](/ccip/supported-networks) | <CopyText text="16015286601757825753" code/>, <CopyText text="true" code/> |
       | allowlistSender           | The _message tracker_ contract address                                                                                                                  | Your deployed contract address, <CopyText text="true" code/>               |
       | allowlistSourceChain      | CCIP Chain identifier of the source blockchain. You can find each network's chain selector on the [ supported networks page ](/ccip/supported-networks) | <CopyText text="16015286601757825753" code/>, <CopyText text="true" code/> |

         alt="Chainlink CCIP - Acknowledger Allowlist Ethereum Sepolia and Message Tracker"
         style="max-width: 70%;"
       />

    1. Open MetaMask and select the _Polygon Mumbai_ network.
    1. For each function you expanded and filled in the arguments for, click the **transact** button to call the function. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Wait for each transaction to succeed before calling the following function.

1.  Finally, allow your _acknowledger_ contract as a sender in the _message tracker_ contract on _Ethereum Sepolia_:

    1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, expand the _message tracker_ contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section. Expand the `allowlistSender` function and fill in your _acknowledger_ contract address and <CopyText text="true" code/> as allowed.

       {" "}

       <ClickToZoom
         src="/images/ccip/tutorials/deployed-message-tracker-allowlist-sender.webp"
         alt="Chainlink CCIP - Message Tracker Allowlist Acknowledger"
         style="max-width: 70%;"
       />

    1. Open MetaMask and select the _Ethereum Sepolia_ network.
    1. Click **transact** to call the function. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction.

At this point, you have one _message tracker_ (sender) contract on _Ethereum Sepolia_ and one _acknowledger_ (receiver) contract on _Polygon Mumbai_. You sent `2` LINK to the _message tracker_ contract and `1` LINK to the _acknowledger_ contract to pay the CCIP fees.

### Send data and track the message status

#### Initial message

1. Send a `Hello World!` string from your _message tracker_ contract on _Ethereum Sepolia_ to your _acknowledger_ contract deployed on _Polygon Mumbai_. You will track the status of this message during this tutorial.

   1. Open MetaMask and select the _Ethereum Sepolia_ network.
   1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, expand the _message tracker_ contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section.
   1. Expand the **sendMessagePayLINK** function and fill in the following arguments:

      | Argument                 | Description                                                                                                                                             | Value (_Polygon Mumbai_)                      |
      | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
      | destinationChainSelector | CCIP Chain identifier of the target blockchain. You can find each network's chain selector on the [ supported networks page ](/ccip/supported-networks) | <CopyText text="12532609583862916517" code/>  |
      | receiver                 | The destination smart contract address                                                                                                                  | Your deployed _acknowledger_ contract address |
      | text                     | Any `string`                                                                                                                                            | <CopyText text="Hello World!" code/>          |

      <ClickToZoom
        src="/images/ccip/tutorials/message-tracker-send-message.webp"
        alt="Chainlink CCIP - Message Tracker Send Message to Acknowledger"
        style="max-width: 70%;"
      />

   1. Click **transact** to call the function. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction.

      <Aside type="note">
        During gas price spikes, your transaction might fail, requiring more than _3 LINK_ to proceed. If your
        transaction fails, fund your contract with more _LINK_ tokens and try again.
      </Aside>

   1. Upon transaction success, expand the last transaction in the Remix log and copy the transaction hash. In this example, it is `0x69ada1a3d014386440f52e609f08d7c60a23727b2dafccaf10d407fb827d44d3`.

      <ClickToZoom
        src="/images/ccip/tutorials/message-tracker-send-message-txn-hash.webp"
        alt="Chainlink CCIP - Message Tracker Send Message Transaction Hash"
        style="max-width: 70%;"
      />

1. Open the [CCIP Explorer](https://ccip.chain.link/) and use the transaction hash you copied to search for your cross-chain transaction.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/ccip/tutorials/ccip-explorer-sepolia-mumbai.webp"
     alt="Chainlink CCIP Explorer - Sepolia to Mumbai Transaction Details"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

   After the transaction is finalized on the source chain, it will take a few minutes for CCIP to deliver the data to _Polygon Mumbai_ and call the `ccipReceive` function on your _acknowledger_ contract.

1. Copy the message ID from the CCIP Explorer transaction details. You will use this message ID to track your message status on the _message tracker_ contract. In this example, it is `0x8773e27ea01eb0e7671da8d63e14a647713cb1274b7110141d249d3b8fce116b`.

1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, expand your _message tracker_ contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section.

1. Paste the message ID you copied from the CCIP explorer as the argument in the **messagesInfo** getter function. Click **messagesInfo** to read the message status.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/ccip/tutorials/message-tracker-message-status-1.webp"
     alt="Chainlink CCIP - Message Tracker Get Message Status - 1"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

   Note the returned `status 1`. This value indicates that the _message tracker_ contract has updated your message status to the `Sent` status as defined by the `MessageStatus` `enum` in the _message tracker_ contract.

   ```solidity
   // Enum is used to track the status of messages sent via CCIP.
   // `NotSent` indicates a message has not yet been sent.
   // `Sent` indicates that a message has been sent to the Acknowledger contract but not yet acknowledged.
   // `Confirmed` indicates that the Message Tracker contract has received the acknowledgment from the Acknowledger contract.
   enum MessageStatus {
     NotSent, // 0
     Sent, // 1
     Confirmed // 2
   }
   ```

1. When the transaction is marked with a "Success" status on the [CCIP Explorer](https://ccip.chain.link/), the CCIP transaction and the destination transaction are complete. The _acknowledger_ contract has received the message from the _message tracker_ contract.

   <ClickToZoom

     alt="Chainlink CCIP Explorer - Sepolia to Mumbai Transaction Success"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

#### Acknowledgment message

The `acknowledgePayLINK` function acts as a custom [`sendMessagePayLINK`](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data#sending-data-and-pay-in-link) function nested within the `ccipReceive` function of the _acknowledger_ contract and sends an acknowledgment (a CCIP message) to the _message tracker_ contract upon the initial message receipt. The data transferred in this acknowledgment message is the initial message ID.

When the acknowledgment message is sent to the _message tracker_ contract, the _acknowledger_ contract emits an `AcknowledgmentSent` event.

```solidity
// Emitted when an acknowledgment message is successfully sent back to the sender contract.
// This event signifies that the Acknowledger contract has recognized the receipt of an initial message
// and has informed the original sender contract by sending an acknowledgment message,
// including the original message ID.
event AcknowledgmentSent(
  bytes32 indexed messageId, // The unique ID of the CCIP message.
  uint64 indexed destinationChainSelector, // The chain selector of the destination chain.
  address indexed receiver, // The address of the receiver on the destination chain.
  bytes32 data, // The data being sent back, usually containing the message ID of the original message to acknowledge its receipt.
  address feeToken, // The token address used to pay CCIP fees for sending the acknowledgment.
  uint256 fees // The fees paid for sending the acknowledgment message via CCIP.
);
```

1. Copy your _acknowledger_ contract address from Remix. Open the [_Polygon Mumbai_ explorer](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com) and search for your deployed _acknowledger_ contract, then click on the **Events** tab.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/ccip/tutorials/polygon-mumbai-explorer-acknowledger-events.webp"
     alt="Chainlink CCIP - Acknowledger Get Last Received Message Details"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

   The first indexed topic (`topic1`) in the `AcknowledgmentSent` event is the acknowledgment message ID sent to the _message tracker_ contract on _Ethereum Sepolia_. In this example, the message ID is `0x0defcd4d21415378e7136b7300940fb8c0e9e046002aa9b54a0362ecb5cee0ec`.

1. Copy your own message ID from the indexed `topic1` and search for it in the [CCIP explorer](https://ccip.chain.link/).

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/ccip/tutorials/ccip-explorer-mumbai-sepolia-success.webp"
     alt="Chainlink CCIP - CCIP Explorer Mumbai to Sepolia Transaction Success"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

   When the transaction is marked with a "Success" status on the CCIP explorer, the CCIP transaction and the destination transaction are complete. The _message tracker_ contract has received the message from the _acknowledger_ contract.

#### Final status check

Upon reception of the acknowledgment message, the _message tracker_ `ccipReceive` function updates the initial message status to `2`, which corresponds to the `Confirmed` status as defined by the `MessageStatus` `enum` and emits a `MessageConfirmed` event.

1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, expand your _message tracker_ contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section.

1. Paste the message ID you copied from the CCIP explorer as the argument in the **messagesInfo** getter function. Click **messagesInfo** to read the message status. It returns `status 2` and the acknowledger message ID that confirms this status.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/ccip/tutorials/message-tracker-message-status-2.webp"
     alt="Chainlink CCIP - Message Tracker Get Message Status - 2"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Copy your _message tracker_ contract address from Remix. Open the [_Ethereum Sepolia_ explorer](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) and search for your deployed _message tracker_ contract. Then, click on the **Events** tab.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/ccip/tutorials/message-tracker-messageconfirmed-event.webp"
     alt="Chainlink CCIP - Message Tracker Message Confirmed Event"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

   The `MessageConfirmed` event is emitted with the acknowledged message ID `0x8773e27ea01eb0e7671da8d63e14a647713cb1274b7110141d249d3b8fce116b` as indexed `topic2`.

   ```solidity
   // Event emitted when the sender contract receives an acknowledgment
   // that the receiver contract has successfully received and processed the message.
   event MessageConfirmed(
     bytes32 indexed messageId, // The unique ID of the CCIP message.
     bytes32 indexed acknowledgedMsgId, // The unique ID of the message acknowledged by the receiver.
     uint64 indexed sourceChainSelector, // The chain selector of the source chain.
     address sender // The address of the sender from the source chain.
   );
   ```

## Explanation

The smart contracts featured in this tutorial are designed to interact with CCIP to send and receive messages and acknowledge message reception. The contract code across both contracts contains supporting comments clarifying the functions, events, and underlying logic.

Refer to the [Send Arbitrary Data](/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data#explanation) tutorial for more explanation about initializing the contracts, sending data, paying in LINK, and receiving data.

Here, we will further explain the acknowledgment of receipt mechanism.

### Message acknowledgment mechanism

The core of this tutorial is demonstrating a message acknowledgment mechanism between two smart contracts across different blockchains. This mechanism ensures that messages sent via CCIP are received and confirmed by the recipient contract.

### _Message tracker_ contract

The _message tracker_ contract acts as the sender, initiating cross-chain communication. It performs the following operations:

- **Message sending**: Constructs and sends messages to the _acknowledger_ contract on another blockchain, using [`sendMessagePayLINK`](/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data#sending-data-and-pay-in-link) function.

- **Status tracking**:
  - Upon sending a message, the _message tracker_ updates its internal state to mark the message as `Sent`. This status is pivotal for tracking the message lifecycle and awaiting acknowledgment.
  - Upon receiving an acknowledgment message from the _acknowledger_ contract, the _message tracker_ contract updates the message status from `Sent` to `Confirmed`, indicating that the cross-chain communication cycle is complete and the recipient successfully received and acknowledged the message.

### _Acknowledger_ contract

The _acknowledger_ contract receives the message and, upon processing, sends back an acknowledgment (a CCIP message). It ensures that:

- **Message receipt**: Upon receiving a message via CCIP, it decodes the message and calls the `acknowledgePayLINK` internal function that is nested within the [`ccipReceive`](/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data#receiving-data) function.

- **Acknowledgment sending**: `acknowledgePayLINK` constructs an acknowledgment message and sends it back to the _message tracker_ contract, signaling that the original message was received and processed.

```solidity
/// @notice Sends an acknowledgment message back to the sender contract.
/// @dev This function constructs and sends an acknowledgment message using CCIP,
/// indicating the receipt and processing of an initial message. It emits the `AcknowledgmentSent` event
/// upon successful sending. This function should be called after processing the received message
/// to inform the sender contract about the successful message reception.
/// @param _messageIdToAcknowledge The message ID of the initial message being acknowledged.
function _acknowledgePayLINK(bytes32 _messageIdToAcknowledge) internal {
  // Construct the CCIP message for acknowledgment, including the message ID of the initial message.
  Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory acknowledgment = _buildCCIPMessage(
    s_messageTrackerAddress, // The sender contract that awaits acknowledgment.
    _messageIdToAcknowledge, // The ID of the message to acknowledge.
    address(s_linkToken) // The token used to pay for the CCIP message transmission.
  );

  // Initialize a router client instance to interact with the cross-chain router.
  IRouterClient router = IRouterClient(this.getRouter());

  // Calculate the fee required to send the CCIP acknowledgment message.
  uint256 fees = router.getFee(
    s_messageTrackerChainSelector, // The chain selector for routing the message.
    acknowledgment // The acknowledgment message data.
  );

  // Ensure the contract has sufficient balance to cover the message sending fees.
  if (fees > s_linkToken.balanceOf(address(this))) {
    revert NotEnoughBalance(s_linkToken.balanceOf(address(this)), fees);
  }

  // Approve the router to transfer LINK tokens on behalf of this contract to cover the sending fees.
  s_linkToken.approve(address(router), fees);

  // Send the acknowledgment message via the CCIP router and capture the resulting message ID.
  bytes32 messageId = router.ccipSend(
    s_messageTrackerChainSelector, // The destination chain selector.
    acknowledgment // The CCIP message payload for acknowledgment.
  );

  // Emit an event detailing the acknowledgment message sending, for external tracking and verification.
  emit AcknowledgmentSent(
    messageId, // The ID of the sent acknowledgment message.
    s_messageTrackerChainSelector, // The destination chain selector.
    s_messageTrackerAddress, // The receiver of the acknowledgment, typically the original sender.
    _messageIdToAcknowledge, // The original message ID that was acknowledged.
    address(s_linkToken), // The fee token used.
    fees // The fees paid for sending the message.

### Security and integrity

Both contracts use allowlists to process only messages from trusted sources.

- **Allowlisting chains and senders**: The contracts verify that the source chain and sender are on their respective allowlists before processing any messages.

- **Verifying message authenticity**: The _message tracker_ contract ensures that acknowledgment messages are received only for messages it has sent, guarding against replay or spoofing attacks.

## Final note

In this example, the _message tracker_ contract emits an event when it receives the acknowledgment message confirming the initial message reception on the counterpart chain. However, you could think of any other logic to execute upon acknowledgment receipt. Also, this tutorial showcases a simple case of sending and confirming receipt of a message containing a `string`, but you could think of any other instances where tokens or tokens and data are transferred cross-chain.
