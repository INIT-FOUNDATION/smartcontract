### Updates

- Added support for USDC transfers. For applicable lanes, refer to the [Supported Networks](/ccip/supported-networks/v1_2_0/testnet).

- The gas limit and maximum message data length for CCIP messages have been adjusted on testnets. These changes are detailed below and in the updated [Service Limits](/ccip/service-limits) documentation.

  - Gas Limit:
    - In v1.0.0, the gas limit is set at 4,000,000.
    - For v1.2.0, this has been reduced to 3,000,000.
  - Maximum Message Data Length:
    - In v1.0.0, the maximum message data length is 50 kilobytes.
    - In v1.2.0, this has been adjusted to 30 kilobytes.

### Notices

- CCIP v1.0.0 has been deprecated on testnet. Users must use the new router addresses mentioned in the [CCIP v1.2.0
  configuration page](/ccip/supported-networks/v1_2_0/testnet) **before January 31st, 2024**. Please note that there is
  no change to the router interface. The CCIP v1.0 testnet routers will continue to function in parallel **until January
  31st, 2024**, but we highly recommend switching to the v1.2 routers as soon as possible.
