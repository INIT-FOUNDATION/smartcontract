## v1.2.0 release on testnet - 2023-12-08

<Aside type="caution" title="Deprecation Notice for CCIP v1.0.0 on Testnet">
  CCIP v1.0.0 has been deprecated on testnet. Users must use the new router addresses mentioned in the [CCIP v1.2.0
  configuration page](/ccip/supported-networks/v1_2_0/testnet) **before January 31st, 2024**. Please note that there is
  no change to the router interface. The CCIP v1.0 testnet routers will continue to function in parallel **until January
  31st, 2024**, but we highly recommend switching to the v1.2 routers as soon as possible.
</Aside>

- Added support for USDC transfers. USDC transfers are currently supported on the following lanes:

  - From Optimism Goerli to Avalanche Fuji.
  - From Optimism Goerli to Base Goerli.
  - From Avalanche Fuji to Optimism Goerli.
  - From Avalanche Fuji to Base Goerli.
  - From Base Goerli to Optimism Goerli.
  - From Base Goerli to Avalanche Fuji.

  Refer to the [Supported Networks](/ccip/supported-networks/v1_2_0/testnet) to get a specific lane's token addresses and rate limits.

- We've simplified the message sequencing process in our CCIP message handling by removing the `strict` sequencing flag. This change affects how messages are processed when using the [extraArgs](/ccip/api-reference/client#evmextraargsv1) field in [CCIP messages](/ccip/api-reference/client#evm2anymessage).

  - Previous behavior (v1.0.0):

    CCIP always processes messages sent from a specific sender to a specific destination blockchain in the order they were sent. If you set `strict: true` in the `extraArgs` part of the message, and if the `ccipReceive` fails (reverts), it will prevent any following messages from the same sender from being processed until the current message is successfully executed.
    With this update, the 'strict' flag option is no longer available.

  - Current behavior (v1.2.0):

    CCIP will now always process messages, irrespective of the success or failure of individual messages. This means that even if a `ccipReceive` fails (reverts) on the destination chain for a given message, subsequent messages will still be processed without interruption.

- The gas limit and maximum message data length for CCIP messages have been adjusted on testnets. These changes are detailed below and in the updated [Service Limits](/ccip/service-limits) documentation.

  - Gas Limit:
    - In v1.0.0, the gas limit is 2,000,000.
    - For v1.2.0, this has been increased to 3,000,000.
  - Maximum Message Data Length:
    - In v1.0.0, the maximum message data length is 50 kilobytes.
    - In v1.2.0, this has been adjusted to 30 kilobytes.
