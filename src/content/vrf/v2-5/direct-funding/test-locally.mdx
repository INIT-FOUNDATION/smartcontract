This guide explains how to test Chainlink VRF v2.5 on a [Remix IDE](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run.html#environment) sandbox blockchain environment. **Note**: You can reuse the same logic on another development environment, such as Hardhat. For example, read the Hardhat Starter Kit [RandomNumberDirectFundingConsumer unit tests](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit/blob/main/test/unit/RandomNumberDirectFundingConsumer.spec.js).

<Aside type="caution" title="Test on public testnets thoroughly">
  Even though local testing has several benefits, testing with a VRF mock covers the bare minimum of use cases. Make
  sure to test your consumer contract throughly on public testnets.
</Aside>

## Benefits of local testing

<ContentCommon section="localTestingBenefits" />

## Testing logic

Complete the following tasks to test your VRF v2.5 consumer locally:

1. Deploy the [VRFCoordinatorV2_5Mock](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/mocks/VRFCoordinatorV2_5Mock.sol). This contract is a mock of the [VRFCoordinatorV2_5](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFCoordinatorV2_5.sol) contract.
1. Deploy the [MockV3Aggregator](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/tests/MockV3Aggregator.sol) contract.
1. Deploy the [LinkToken](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/token/ERC677/LinkToken.sol) contract.
1. Deploy the [VRFV2PlusWrapper](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFV2PlusWrapper.sol) contract.
1. Call the VRFV2PlusWrapper [setConfig function](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFV2PlusWrapper.sol#L235) to set wrapper specific parameters.
1. Fund the VRFV2PlusWrapper subscription.
1. Call the [addConsumer function](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/interfaces/IVRFSubscriptionV2Plus.sol#L12) to add the wrapper contract to your subscription. (VRFCoordinatorV2_5Mock inherits this function from the IVRFSubscriptionV2Plus interface.)
1. Deploy your VRF consumer contract.
1. Fund your consumer contract with LINK tokens.
1. Request random words from your consumer contract.
1. Call the VRFCoordinatorV2_5Mock [fulfillRandomWords function](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/mocks/VRFCoordinatorV2_5Mock.sol#L102) to fulfill your consumer contract request.

## Prerequisites

This guide will require you to finetune the gas limit when fulfilling requests. When writing, manually setting up the gas limits on Remix IDE is not supported, so you will use Remix IDE in conjunction with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).

Hardhat lets you run an Ethereum blockchain locally for testing. Use the [Hardhat Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit) to quickly fire up a personal Ethereum blockchain.

1. Install the Hardhat Starter Kit and its dependencies:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit/
   cd hardhat-starter-kit && npm install
   ```

1. At the root directory of `hardhat-starter-kit`, start an Ethereum blockchain locally:

   ```
   npx hardhat node
   ```

   The output includes the RPC server and the addresses and private keys for 20 test accounts. The first one is shown below. First, make sure to note the RPC server. In this example, the RPC server is `http://127.0.0.1:8545/`:

   ```
   Started HTTP and WebSocket JSON-RPC server at http://127.0.0.1:8545/

   Accounts
   ========

   WARNING: These accounts, and their private keys, are publicly known.
   Any funds sent to them on Mainnet or any other live network WILL BE LOST.

   Account #0: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 (10000 ETH)
   Private Key: 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80

   ...

   WARNING: These accounts, and their private keys, are publicly known.
   Any funds sent to them on Mainnet or any other live network WILL BE LOST.
   ```

   After the test account information, you will see output indicating that the Ethereum blockchain is running locally:

   ```
   eth_blockNumber (14)
   eth_chainId (6)
   eth_blockNumber (2)
   eth_getBalance (3)
   eth_getBlockByNumber
   eth_blockNumber
   net_version (2)
   eth_chainId
   ```

1. Follow the MetaMask [official guide](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC#h_01G63GGJ83DGDRCS2ZWXM37CV5) to add a custom network manually.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/metamaskcustomnetwork.jpg" />

1. Import the first Hardhat test account into MetaMask.

   1. In the terminal window where you're running the local Ethereum blockchain, scroll up in the output to the test account information. Copy the private key for the first account:

      ```
      Started HTTP and WebSocket JSON-RPC server at http://127.0.0.1:8545/

      Accounts
      ========

      WARNING: These accounts, and their private keys, are publicly known.
      Any funds sent to them on Mainnet or any other live network WILL BE LOST.

      Account #0: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 (10000 ETH)
      Private Key: 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80

      ...
      ```

   1. Follow the MetaMask [official guide](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489331-How-to-import-an-account) to import an account using a private key.

   1. Your MetaMask is connected to the Hardhat test account, and you should have access to the newly imported account.

1. Open _VRFCoordinatorV2_5Mock.sol_.

1. Under _DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS_, select _VRFCoordinatorV2_5Mock_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deploymockdf.jpg" />

1. Under _DEPLOY_, fill in the `_BASEFEE` and `_GASPRICELINK`. These variables are used in the _VRFCoordinatorV2_5Mock_ contract to represent the base fee and the gas price (in LINK tokens) for the VRF requests. You can set: `_BASEFEE=100000000000000000` and `_GASPRICELINK=1000000000`.

1. Click on _transact_ to deploy the _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock_ contract.

1. A MetaMask popup will open. Click on _Confirm_.

1. Once deployed, you should see the _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock_ contract under _Deployed Contracts_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deployedmockdf.jpg" />

1. Note the address of the deployed contract.

### Deploy MockV3Aggregator

The _MockV3Aggregator_ contract is designed for testing purposes, allowing you to simulate an oracle price feed without interacting with the existing Chainlink network.

1. Open _MockV3Aggregator.sol_.

1. Under _DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS_, select _MockV3Aggregator_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deployaggregatormock.jpg" />

1. Under _DEPLOY_, fill in `_DECIMALS` and `_INITIALANSWER`. These variables are used in the _MockV3Aggregator_ contract to represent the number of decimals the aggregator's answer should have and the most recent price feed answer. You can set: `_DECIMALS=18` and `_INITIALANSWER=3000000000000000` (We are considering that `1 LINK = 0.003 native gas tokens`).

1. Click on _transact_ to deploy the _MockV3Aggregator_ contract.

1. A MetaMask popup will open. Click on _Confirm_.

1. Once deployed, you should see the _MockV3Aggregator_ contract under _Deployed Contracts_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deployedaggregatormock.jpg" />

1. Note the address of the deployed contract.

### Deploy LinkToken

The Chainlink VRF v2.5 direct funding method requires your consumer contract to pay for VRF requests in LINK. Therefore, you have to deploy the _LinkToken_ contract to your local blockchain.

1. Open _LinkToken.sol_.

1. Under _DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS_, select _LinkToken_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deploylink.jpg" />

1. Once deployed, you should see the _LinkToken_ contract under _Deployed Contracts_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deployedlink.jpg" />

1. Note the address of the deployed contract.

### Deploy VRFV2PlusWrapper

As the VRF v2.5 direct funding [end-to-end diagram](/vrf/v2-5/direct-funding#request-and-receive-data) explains, the _VRFV2PlusWrapper_ acts as a wrapper for the coordinator contract.

1. Open _VRFV2PlusWrapper.sol_.

1. Under _DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS_, select _VRFV2Wrapper_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deploywrapper.jpg" />

1. Under _DEPLOY_, fill in `_LINK` with the _LinkToken_ contract address, `_LINKETHFEED` with the _MockV3Aggregator_ contract address, and `_COORDINATOR` with the _VRFCoordinatorV2_5Mock_ contract address.

1. Click on _transact_ to deploy the _VRFV2PlusWrapper_ contract.

1. A MetaMask popup will open. Click on _Confirm_.

1. Once deployed, you should see the _VRFV2PlusWrapper_ contract under _Deployed Contracts_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deployedwrapper.jpg" />

1. Note the address of the deployed contract.

### Configure the VRFV2PlusWrapper

1. Under _Deployed Contracts_, open the functions list of your deployed _VRFV2PlusWrapper_ contract.

1. Click on `setConfig` and fill in `_wrapperGasOverhead` with `60000`, `_coordinatorGasOverhead` with `52000`, `_wrapperPremiumPercentage` with `10`, `_keyHash` with `0xd89b2bf150e3b9e13446986e571fb9cab24b13cea0a43ea20a6049a85cc807cc`, and `_maxNumWords` with `10`. **Note** on these variables:

   1. `_wrapperGasOverhead`: This variable reflects the gas overhead of the wrapper's fulfillRandomWords function. The cost for this gas is passed to the user.

   1. `_coordinatorGasOverhead`: This variable reflects the gas overhead of the coordinator's `fulfillRandomWords` function. The cost for this gas is billed to the _VRFV2PlusWrapper_ subscription and must, therefore, be included in the VRF v2.5 direct funding requests pricing.

   1. `_wrapperPremiumPercentage`: This variable is the premium ratio in percentage. For example, a value of 0 indicates no premium. A value of 15 indicates a 15 percent premium.

   1. `_keyHash`: The gas lane key hash value is the maximum gas price you are willing to pay for a request in wei.

   1. `_maxNumWords`: This variable is the maximum number of words requested in a VRF v2.5 direct funding request.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-wrappersetconfig.jpg" />

1. click on _transact_.

1. A MetaMask popup will open. Click on _Confirm_.

### Fund the VRFV2PlusWrapper subscription

When deployed, the _VRFV2PlusWrapper_ contract creates a new subscription and adds itself to the newly created subscription.

1. Under _Deployed Contracts_, open the functions list of your deployed _VRFCoordinatorV2_5Mock_ contract.

1. Click `fundSubscription` to fund the _VRFV2PlusWrapper_ subscription. In this example, you can set the `_subid` to `1` (which is your newly created subscription ID) and the `_amount` to `10000000000000000000` (10 LINK).

1. A MetaMask popup will open. Click on _Confirm_.

### Deploy the VRF consumer contract

1. In the file explorer, open _RandomNumberDirectFundingConsumerV2_5.sol_.

1. Under _DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS_, select _RandomNumberDirectFundingConsumerV2_5_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deploydfconsumer.jpg" />

1. Under _DEPLOY_, fill in `_LINKADDRESS_` with the _LinkToken_ contract address, and `_WRAPPERADDRESS_` with the deployed _VRFV2PlusWrapper_ address.

1. Click on _transact_ to deploy the _RandomNumberDirectFundingConsumerV2_5_ contract.

1. A MetaMask popup will open. Click on _Confirm_.

1. Once deployed, you should see the _RandomNumberDirectFundingConsumerV2_5_ contract under _Deployed Contracts_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deployeddfconsumer.jpg" />

1. Note the address of the deployed contract.

### Fund your VRF consumer contract

1. Under _Deployed Contracts_, open the functions list of your deployed _LinkToken_ contract.

1. Click on _transfer_ and fill in the `_to` with your consumer contract address and `_value` with LINK tokens amount. For this example, you can set the `_value` to `10000000000000000000` (10 LINK).

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-linktransfer.jpg" />

1. Click on _transact_.

1. A MetaMask popup will open. Click on _Confirm_.

### Request random words

Request three random words.

1. Under _Deployed Contracts_, open the functions list of your deployed _RandomNumberConsumerV2_5_ contract.

1. In `requestRandomWords`, fill in `_callbackGasLimit` with `300000`, `_requestConfirmations` with `3` and `_numWords` with `3`.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-requestrandomwordsdf.jpg" />

1. Click on _transact_.

1. A MetaMask popup will open.

     <Aside type="note" title="Set your gas limit in MetaMask">

   Remix IDE doesn't set the right gas limit, so you must [edit the
   gas limit in MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360022895972) within the **Advanced gas controls** settings.

   For this example to work, set the gas limit to _400,000_ in MetaMask.

   First, [enable **Advanced gas controls** in your MetaMask settings](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360022895972).

   Before confirming your transaction in MetaMask, navigate to the screen where you can edit the gas limit: Select **Site suggested** > **Advanced** > **Advanced gas controls** and select **Edit** next to the **Gas limit** amount. Update the **Gas limit** value to _400000_ and select **Save**. Finally, confirm the transaction.

     </Aside>

1. Click on _Confirm_.

1. In the Remix IDE console, read your transaction logs to find the VRF request ID. In this example, the request ID is _1_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-requestrandomwordslogsdf.jpg" />

1. Note your request ID.

### Fulfill the VRF request

Because you are testing on a local blockchain environment, you must fulfill the VRF request yourself.

1. Under _Deployed Contracts_, open the functions list of your deployed _VRFCoordinatorV2_5Mock_ contract.

1. Click `fulfillRandomWords` and fill in `_requestId` with your VRF request ID and `_consumer` with the _VRFV2Wrapper_ contract address.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-fulfillrandomwordsdf.jpg" />

1. Click on `transact`.

1. A MetaMask popup will open.

   <Aside type="note" title="Set your gas limit in MetaMask">

   </Aside>

1. Click on _Confirm_.

1. In the Remix IDE console, read your transaction logs to find the random words.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-requestfulfilledlogsdf.jpg" />

### Check the results

1. Under _Deployed Contracts_, open the functions list of your deployed _RandomNumberDirectFundingConsumerV2_5_ contract.

1. Click on `lastRequestId` to display the last request ID. In this example, the output is _1_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deployedconsumerrequestiddf.jpg" />

1. Click on `getRequestStatus` with `_requestId` equal to `1`:

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deployedconsumerrequeststatusdf.jpg" />

1. You will get the amount paid, the status, and the random words.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deployedconsumerrequeststatusresultsdf.jpg" />

## Next steps

This guide demonstrated how to test a VRF v2.5 consumer contract on your local blockchain. We made the guide on Remix IDE for learning purposes, but you can reuse the same [testing logic](#testing-logic) in other development environments. For example, you can test entirely with the Hardhat Starter Kit [RandomNumberDirectFundingConsumer unit tests](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit/blob/main/test/unit/RandomNumberDirectFundingConsumer.spec.js).
