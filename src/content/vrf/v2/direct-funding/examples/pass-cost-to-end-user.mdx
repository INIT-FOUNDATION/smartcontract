This tutorial shows you how to identify the cost of specific VRF requests so that you can pass this cost to the end users of your application.

## Objective

The VRF direct funding method calculates costs at request time. In this tutorial, you will use VRF direct funding and map VRF request IDs to their corresponding responses from the VRF service, along with the cost of each request.

<Aside type="caution" title="Disclaimer">

  to interact with Chainlink's systems and services so that you can integrate them into your own. This template is

  checks or error handling to make the usage of the product more clear. Do not use the code in this example in a
  production environment without completing your own audits and application of best practices. Neither Chainlink Labs,
  the Chainlink Foundation, nor Chainlink node operators are responsible for unintended outputs that are generated due

   1. The Xcode command line tools include `make`. If you've previously installed Xcode, skip to step 2 to verify your installation. Otherwise, open a Terminal window and run:
      ```sh
      xcode-select --install
      ```
      Alternatively, if you prefer to [use Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make), be aware that GNU `make` is installed as `gmake`.
   1.  Verify your `make` installation:
         ```sh
         make
         ```
         If `make` is installed successfully, you will get the following output:

- Run `git --version` to check your `git` installation. You should see an output similar to `git version x.x.x`. If not, install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
- Get your Etherscan API key for contract verification. If you do not already have one:
  - [Create an Etherscan account](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/creating-an-account).
  - [Create an Etherscan API key](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics).
- Create an account with [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) to use as an RPC endpoint if you do not already have one. Alternatively, you can [use your own testnet clients](/chainlink-nodes/resources/run-an-ethereum-client).

## Setup steps

This tutorial requires several setup steps:

- [Clone the example repo](#clone-the-example-repo)
- [Configure the Foundry project](#configure-the-foundry-project)
- [Install dependencies](#install-dependencies)

### Clone the example repo

Clone the [`vrf-direct-funding-example` repo](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/vrf-direct-funding-example):

```sh
git clone git@github.com:smartcontractkit/vrf-direct-funding-example.git
```

This gives you an existing [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) project to configure and use.

### Configure the Foundry project

[Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) is an Ethereum application development toolkit that is used here to configure and deploy the contract. You need the following information:

- The RPC URL for your deployment network, using an [RPC node provider](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/nodes-as-a-service/) such as [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).
- The private key for your deployer account. If your deployer account is in MetaMask, [export your private key from MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).
- An [Etherscan API key](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics) for contract verification.

1. Create an `.env` file at the root of the `vrf-direct-funding-example/` directory:

   ```
   # Network RPCs
   export RPC_URL=

   # Private key for contract deployment
   export PRIVATE_KEY=

   # Explorer API key used to verify contracts
   export EXPLORER_KEY=
   ```

1. In your `.env` file, fill in these values:

   | Parameter      | Description                                                 | Example                                     |
   | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
   | `RPC_URL`      | The RPC URL for the network you want to deploy to.          | `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your-api-key` |
   | `PRIVATE_KEY`  | The private key of the account you want to deploy from.     | `0xabc123abc123abc123abc123abc123...`       |
   | `EXPLORER_KEY` | The API key for Etherscan needed for contract verification. | `ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC1`        |

### Install dependencies

At the root of the `vrf-direct-funding-example/` directory, run:

```sh
make install
```

This command will install the project dependencies, which include [chainlink](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink) and [openzepplin-contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) for secure smart contract development.

## Deploy and test

Foundry includes [Forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/crates/forge), an Ethereum testing framework. Deployment and testing are both scripted within this Foundry project. The project's [Makefile](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/vrf-direct-funding-example/blob/main/Makefile) helps you invoke Forge with simple commands to start the deployment and testing scripts.

1. At the root of the `vrf-direct-funding-example/` directory, run this command to deploy the contract:

   {/* Command to run */}

   ```shell
   make deploy
   ```

1. To test the contract, run this command:

   ```shell
   make test
   ```

## Code example

This section explains how the [`VRFDirectFundingConsumer.sol`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/vrf-direct-funding-example/blob/main/src/VRFDirectFundingConsumer.sol) contract maps each request to its cost.

This `RequestStatus` struct is used to map attributes of each VRF request to its request ID, including its cost, its fulfillment status, and the random values generated by the VRF service in response to the request:

```solidity
struct RequestStatus {
        uint256 paid;
        bool fulfilled;
        uint256[] randomWords;
    }

mapping(uint256 => RequestStatus) public s_requests;
```

The `requestRandomWords()` function uses a method in the VRF wrapper contract to calculate the request cost upfront, and then transfers enough LINK to the VRF wrapper to cover the request. After sending the request, it sets up the `RequestStatus` with the cost and other attributes to be updated after request fulfillment.

```solidity
uint256 requestPrice = vrfWrapper.calculateRequestPrice(
            requestConfig.callbackGasLimit
        );

require(
      linkTokenContract.transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            requestPrice
      ),
      "Not enough LINK"
   );
   ...

   s_requests[requestId] = RequestStatus({
            paid: requestPrice,
            randomWords: new uint256[](0),
            fulfilled: false
        });
```

After the VRF service fulfills your randomness request, it calls back your `fulfillRandomWords()` function, where you implement logic to handle the random values. It's recommended to keep the processing in your callback function minimal to save on gas costs. In this case, the example contract updates the `RequestStatus` in the request mapping, and emits an event indicating that the request has been fulfilled. Another part of your application can listen for this event and further process the random values separately from the callback function.

```solidity
function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 _requestId, uint256[] memory _randomWords) internal override {
  require(s_requests[_requestId].paid > 0, "request not found");
  s_requests[_requestId].fulfilled = true;
  s_requests[_requestId].randomWords = _randomWords;
  emit RequestFulfilled(_requestId, _randomWords, s_requests[_requestId].paid);
}
```
