In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up a time-based upkeep using the Chainlink tutorial.

## Overview

Time-based upkeeps allow you to set a scheduled time of execution for a smart contract function that you define, without the need for any manual intervention. They are also called “cron upkeeps”.

You can use this to:

- Schedule a rebalancing activity
- Schedule a recurring payment
- Schedule circuit breaker checks
- Automate triggering of any smart contract function that needs to run on a certain time schedule, or at a certain time in the future

## Before you begin

Before you start this tutorial, complete the following items:

- You have a wallet set up
- You have the gas currency for the chain (example: ETH, Matic) in your wallet
- You have ERC-677 LINK in your wallet. [Faucet link if you need LINK](https://faucets.chain.link/)
- You have a smart contract that has an external/public function that you want called at a certain time or with a certain frequency

## Provide contract information

If your smart contract is already verified on chain, skip to the next step.

Chainlink Automation needs your smart contract's [Application Binary Interface](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) (ABI) in order to automate the public functions in your contract. If your smart contract is not verified on chain, you must either provide your contract's ABI manually, or verify the contract on chain.

If you do not want to verify the contract on chain, paste the [Application Binary Interface](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) (ABI) of the deployed contract into the corresponding text box.

1.  Copy the ABI from Remix here:

1.  In the Chainlink Automation App, paste the ABI into the ABI field:

    </Fragment>
<Fragment slot="panel.2">
Verify your contract in the blockchain explorer by adding your contract's source code and other required information in the blockchain explorer UI.

After you successfully verify your smart contract, its ABI becomes publicly available, so Chainlink Automation will be able to access it.

## Register a new Upkeep

<div class="remix-callout">
  <a href="https://automation.chain.link">Open the Chainlink Automation App</a>
</div>

1. **Click the Register New Upkeep button**
   ![Click Register New Upkeep](/images/contract-devs/automation/auto-ui-home.png)

1. **Connect your wallet** using the _Connect Wallet_ choose a network. For a list of supported networks, see the [Supported Blockchain Networks](/chainlink-automation/supported-networks) section. The Chainlink Automation App also lists the currently supported networks.

1. **Select the custom logic trigger**

1. **Provide the address of your [compatible contract](/chainlink-automation/compatible-contracts)** You do not need to verify the contract on-chain, but it must be [compatible](/chainlink-automation/compatible-contracts) with the `AutomationCompatibleInterface` contract.

1. **Complete the required details:**

   - **Upkeep name**: This will be publicly visible in the Chainlink Automation app.
   - **Gas limit**: This is the maximum amount of gas that your transaction requires to execute on chain. This limit cannot exceed the `performGasLimit` value configured on the [registry](/chainlink-automation/supported-networks/#configurations). Before the network executes your transaction on chain, it simulates the transaction. If the gas required to execute your transaction exceeds the gas limit that you specified, your transaction will not be confirmed. Developers also have the ability to update `performGasLimit` for an upkeep. Consider running your function on a testnet to see how much gas it uses before you select a gas limit. This can be changed afterwards.
   - **Starting balance (LINK)**: Specify a LINK starting balance to fund your upkeep. See the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts) page to find the correct contract address and access faucets for testnet LINK. This field is required. You must have LINK before you can use the Chainlink Automation service.
   - **Check data**: This field is provided as an input for when your `checkUpkeep` function is simulated. Either leave this field blank or specify a hexadecimal value starting with `0x`. To learn how to make flexible upkeeps using `checkData`, see the [Flexible Upkeeps](/chainlink-automation/flexible-upkeeps) guide.
   - **Your email address**: This email address will be encrypted and is used to send you an email when your upkeep is underfunded.
