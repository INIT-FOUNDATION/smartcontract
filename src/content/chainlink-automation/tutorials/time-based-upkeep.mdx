In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up a time-based upkeep to automate a smart contract function using Chainlink Automation.

Time-based upkeeps are contracts you set up on Chainlink Automation that allow you to run a smart contract function automatically according to a custom schedule that you define. Time-based upkeeps allow you to run cron jobs.

You can use time-based upkeeps to:

- Schedule a rebalancing activity
- Schedule a recurring payment
- Schedule circuit breaker checks
- Automate triggering of any smart contract function that needs to run on a certain time schedule, or at a certain time in the future

## Before you begin

Before you start this tutorial, complete the following items:

- You have a cryptocurrency wallet set up (for example, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/))
- Your wallet is funded with:
  - The gas currency for the chain where your contract is deployed (for example, Sepolia). [Get 0.5 Sepolia ETH](https://sepoliafaucet.com/).
  - ERC-677 LINK. [Get 20 testnet LINK](https://faucets.chain.link/).
- You have a smart contract that has an external or public function that you want called at a certain time or with a certain frequency.

If you do not already have a deployed contract, [follow these instructions to deploy a simple "Hello, world!" contract](/getting-started/deploy-your-first-contract) and then return to this tutorial.

## Provide contract information

If your smart contract is already verified on chain, skip to the next step.

Chainlink Automation needs your smart contract's [Application Binary Interface](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) (ABI) in order to automate the public functions in your contract. If your smart contract is not verified on chain, you must either provide your contract's ABI manually, or verify the contract on chain.

<Fragment slot="tab.2">Add the ABI manually</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="panel.1">

Verify your contract in the blockchain explorer by adding your contract's source code and other required information in the blockchain explorer UI. For example, you can verify contracts deployed to Polygon Mumbai testnet on the [testnet version of Polygonscan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/verifyContract).

After you successfully verify your smart contract, the Chainlink Automation App should be able to fetch its ABI automatically.

If you do not want to verify the contract on chain, paste the contract's [Application Binary Interface](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) (ABI) into the corresponding text box in the Chainlink Automation App while you are registering the upkeep.

1.  Copy the ABI from Remix here:

1.  In the Chainlink Automation App, paste the ABI into the ABI field:

## Register a new Upkeep

<div class="remix-callout">
  <a href="https://automation.chain.link">Open the Chainlink Automation App</a>
</div>

1. **Click the Register New Upkeep button**

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/contract-devs/automation/auto-ui-home.png" alt="Click Register New Upkeep" />

1. **Connect your wallet** using the _Connect Wallet_ choose a network. For a list of supported networks, see the [Supported Blockchain Networks](/chainlink-automation/supported-networks) section. The Chainlink Automation App also lists the currently supported networks.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/contract-devs/automation/auto-ui-wallet.png" alt="Connect With Metamask" />

1. **Select the time-based trigger.**

1. Provide the address of your deployed contract. If your contract is unverified, paste the ABI into the corresponding text box.

1. If you're using the "Hello, World!" contract, add an updated message for the function input in the Chainlink Automation App:

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/qs-time-based-upkeep/new-message.png" alt="Function input" />

### Specifying the time schedule

After you enter the basic contract information, specify your time schedule in the form of a CRON expression. CRON expressions are a shorthand way to create a time schedule. Use the provided example buttons to experiment with different schedules and then create your own.

```
Cron jobs are interpreted according to this format:

  ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
  │ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
  │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
  │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
  │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
  │ │ │ │ │
  │ │ │ │ │
  │ │ │ │ │
  * * * * *

All times are in UTC

- can be used for range e.g. "0 8-16 * * *"
/ can be used for interval e.g. "0 */2 * * *"
, can be used for list e.g. "0 17 * * 0,2,4"

  Special limitations:
    * there is no year field
    * no special characters: ? L W #
    * lists can have a max length of 26
    * no words like JAN / FEB or MON / TUES
```

#### Cron schedule examples

| Cron expression  | Schedule                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `* * * * *`      | Every minute                              |
| `0 8-16 * * *`   | Every hour between 08:00-16:00 UTC        |
| `0 */2 * * *`    | Every two hours                           |
| `0 17 * * 0,2,4` | Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday at 17:00 UTC |

The Chainlink Automation App displays the next five scheduled events to help you confirm that you have entered your desired schedule correctly.

After you enter your CRON expression, click **Next**.

### Entering upkeep details

To complete the upkeep registration process, you must enter some information about your upkeep including its name, gas limit, starting balance LINK, and contact information.

<Aside type="note" title="Job Scheduler Gas requirements">
  When you create an upkeep through the Job Scheduler, Chainlink Automation deploys a new `CronUpkeep` contract from the
  [CronUpkeepFactory](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/d5a253fb6959104844eda8479c08909a76a6fea7/contracts/src/v0.8/automation/upkeeps/CronUpkeepFactory.sol)
  to manage your time schedule and ensure that it is compatible. This contract uses roughly 110K gas per call, so it is
  recommended to add 150K additional gas to the gas limit of the function you are automating.
</Aside>

![Automation Upkeep Details](/images/contract-devs/automation/automation-upkeep-details.png)

1. **Complete the required details:**

   - **Upkeep name**: This will be publicly visible in the Chainlink Automation app.
   - **Gas limit**: This is the maximum amount of gas that your transaction requires to execute on chain. This value defaults to 500000, which is sufficient for the simple `updateMessage` function in the Hello, World! contract. If the gas required to execute your transaction exceeds the gas limit that you specified, your transaction will not be confirmed.
   - **Starting balance (LINK)**: Specify a LINK starting balance to fund your upkeep. If you're using the Hello, World! contract, 3 LINK is a sufficient starting balance. If your upkeep is underfunded after you create it, you can add more funds later.
   - **Your email address**: This email address will be encrypted and is used to send you an email when your upkeep is underfunded.
