In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up a time-based upkeep to automate a smart contract function using Chainlink Automation.

## Overview

Time-based upkeeps are contracts you set up on Chainlink Automation that allow you to run a smart contract function automatically according to a custom schedule that you define. Time-based upkeeps allow you to run cron jobs.

You can use time-based upkeeps to:

- Schedule a rebalancing activity
- Schedule a recurring payment
- Schedule circuit breaker checks
- Automate triggering of any smart contract function that needs to run on a certain time schedule, or at a certain time in the future

## Before you begin

Before you start this tutorial, complete the following items:

- You have a wallet set up
- You have the gas currency for the chain in your wallet
- You have ERC-677 LINK in your wallet. [Faucet link if you need LINK](https://faucets.chain.link/)
- You have a smart contract that has an external or public function that you want called at a certain time or with a certain frequency

## Provide contract information

If your smart contract is already verified on chain, skip to the next step.

Chainlink Automation needs your smart contract's [Application Binary Interface](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) (ABI) in order to automate the public functions in your contract. If your smart contract is not verified on chain, you must either provide your contract's ABI manually, or verify the contract on chain.

Verify your contract in the blockchain explorer by adding your contract's source code and other required information in the blockchain explorer UI. For example, you can verify contracts deployed to Polygon Mumbai testnet on the [testnet version of Polygonscan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/verifyContract).

After you successfully verify your smart contract, its ABI becomes publicly available, so Chainlink Automation will be able to access it.

If you do not want to verify the contract on chain, paste the contract's [Application Binary Interface](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) (ABI) into the corresponding text box in the Chainlink Automation App while you are registering the upkeep.

1.  Copy the ABI from Remix here:

1.  In the Chainlink Automation App, paste the ABI into the ABI field:

## Register a new Upkeep

<div class="remix-callout">
  <a href="https://automation.chain.link">Open the Chainlink Automation App</a>
</div>

1. **Click the Register New Upkeep button**

1. **Connect your wallet** using the _Connect Wallet_ choose a network. For a list of supported networks, see the [Supported Blockchain Networks](/chainlink-automation/supported-networks) section. The Chainlink Automation App also lists the currently supported networks.

1. **Select the time-based trigger.**

1. Provide the address of your deployed contract.

1. **Complete the required details:**

   - **Upkeep name**: This will be publicly visible in the Chainlink Automation app.
   - **Gas limit**: This is the maximum amount of gas that your transaction requires to execute on chain. This limit cannot exceed the `performGasLimit` value configured on the [registry](/chainlink-automation/supported-networks/#configurations). Before the network executes your transaction on chain, it simulates the transaction. If the gas required to execute your transaction exceeds the gas limit that you specified, your transaction will not be confirmed. Developers also have the ability to update `performGasLimit` for an upkeep. Consider running your function on a testnet to see how much gas it uses before you select a gas limit. This can be changed afterwards.
   - **Starting balance (LINK)**: Specify a LINK starting balance to fund your upkeep. See the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts) page to find the correct contract address and access faucets for testnet LINK. This field is required. You must have LINK before you can use the Chainlink Automation service.
   - **Your email address**: This email address will be encrypted and is used to send you an email when your upkeep is underfunded.
