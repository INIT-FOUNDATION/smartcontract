Chainlink Automation v2.0 is a consensus-driven Automation solution that allows you to cut onchain gas costs by leveraging cryptographically verified offchain compute. Automation 2.0 provides more offchain compute (10M gas) than earlier versions with increased reliability and performance. Additionally, it offers new features including Log triggers and StreamsLookup.

Migrating existing upkeeps from v1.2 registries and onwards can be done with the click of a button in the UI[link] or using a chain scanner[link]. Before you migrate, please familiarize yourself with our [migration checklist](#migration-checklist) to maximize your benefits from Automation 2.0. When you migrate upkeeps through the registry you retain the UpkeepID.

For upkeeps on older registry versions 1.0 (Ethereum Mainnet), and v1.1 (BNB Mainnet, and Polygon Mainnet), you must migrate manually by cancelling and re-registering your upkeep in the UI. We have streamlined the process from v1.2 onwards, so this should be the last time you have to cancel and recreate an upkeep to migrate.

<Aside type="caution" title="Deprecation date">
  Please ensure you migrate your upkeeps by 31 March 2024. We will start deprecating earlier registries after this date. Please reach out if you have questions or concerns after reading our documentation.

## Migrating using the UI

The Automation UI offers a streamlined migration process for upkeeps using registry versions 1.2 and later. To migrate upkeeps with older versions, follow the [manual migration process](#migrating-older-upkeeps-manually) instead. 

In the UI, you can migrate one upkeep at a time. Alternatively, you can [migrate multiple upkeeps at once](#migrating-multiple-upkeeps) by using the block scanner.

1. Navigate to the Chainlink Automation UI and connect your wallet. (Note that Automation 2.0 runs on registry version 2.1. This discrepancy will be reconciled in a future version).

1. Select your upkeep. In the details page, select **Migrate Upkeep**.

1. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

Upkeeps that are successfully migrated will show the following transaction logs

Example: https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0x85b3a147518719d3c9b1dd6b80e5f39d53d18c177ebc10d1bfb8890eaab8900a#eventlog 

When the migration is complete: 

- Your balance will automatically be transferred to the new registry.
- The new upkeep details page will show the updated registry address and a forwarder address. The forwarder address is a new unique forwarder to increase security for your upkeep. This address will be the unique `msg.sender` for your upkeep. If your upkeep is restricted to a single address calling it, ensure you give permission to the Forwarder address or your function will stop

## Migrating multiple upkeeps

To migrate multiple upkeeps simultaneously using the scanner:

1. Navigate to the blockscanner for the desired chain to the Automation registry containing your upkeeps. The registry address is visible in the Automation UI under Upkeep details. 

1. Under Contract/Write contract expand the `migrateUpkeeps` function.
Enter a list of upkeepIDs e.g. [99297446083125056953495436926707926113001699970195513612134585638496630959874,63026166139768298778579034679995711427803187091626268721992534052921779884688]

1. Enter the destination registry address, which is the latest registry address on this chain. You can find this address in the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks) page, or on the Automation UI for the desired chain. 

1. Execute the `migrateUpkeeps` function and confirm it. When this transaction is confirmed, your upkeeps will be migrated to the latest registry, and each upkeep will have a unique forwarder address.

## Migrating older upkeeps manually
For upkeeps on registry versions 1.0 and 1.1, you must migrate upkeeps manually:

1. Navigate to the Upkeep in the Automation UI and under Actions select Cancel Upkeep. When this transaction is confirmed, you have to wait 50 blocks before you can withdraw funds.
1. You can then go back to the Automation UI landing page and register a new upkeep providing the Upkeep Address of your old upkeep. The interface remained the same and this upkeep will now be on Automation v2.0 and come with easy migration in future.

## Migration checklist
Please take note of these important changes.

### Unique Forwarder
Automation 2.0 Upkeeps are called from a unique forwarder per upkeep, and not the registry. Thus if your upkeep restricts `msg.sender` to the previous registry address, please update it to the newly created Forwarder Address[link]. The forwarder will only be known once the upkeep has been migrated. The Forwarder will remain constant in future migrations to the next version of Automation.  

### Programmatic Upkeeps will be impacted
Please note that migration moves upkeeps from one registry to another. Thus if you are interacting with your upkeep via solidity or other interfaces, please update the registry and registrar address that you interact with and ensure you use the latest version of the ABI for the registry and registrar.

### Get the latest ABI
For Automation 2.0 ABI, please use IKeeperRegistryMaster.json in /@chainlink/contracts/abi/v0.8/ in the @chainlink NPM package .  Registrar: @chainlink/contracts/abi/v0.8/AutomationRegistrar2_1.json
 You will then be able to execute registry.getForwarder(upkeepID) to get the Forwarder in solidity. The Forwarder will remain constant in future migrations. 

### Check function signatures
Ensure that your function calls to the registry from your upkeep contract (if any) follow the latest ABI.

### Funding will be moved
Your LINK funding will be automatically moved from one registry to the next when you migrate.
