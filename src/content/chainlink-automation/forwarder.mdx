This tutorial explains how to use the `Forwarder` to add additional security to your Automation upkeeps. To learn how other Chainlink Automation contracts work, click [here](/chainlink-automation/automation-contracts).

## What is a `Forwarder`? When is it used?

Starting with Automation 2.0, each registered upkeep under the Chainlink Automation network will have its own unique `Forwarder` contract. This contract is the intermediary between the Automation Registry and the Upkeep contract. Technically speaking, the `Forwarder` will always be the `msg.Sender`for your upkeep.

If your `performUpkeep` function is open and callable by anyone without risk of accepting unintentional external data, you don't need to use the forwarder.

## Securing your upkeep

If your upkeep's perform function needs to be permissioned, please consider adding `msg.sender = registry.getForwarder(upkeepID)` at the top of your `performUpkeep` function.

To make this work you will need to:

- Create `upkeepID` as a variable on your contract that only _you_ can update. `upkeepID` is a unique value that cannot change. It is known only after successful registration.
- A variable storing the address of the registry. Only _you_ should be able to update this variable. update.
- Call `registry.getForwarder(upkeepID)` using the Registry interface.
