The following diagram describes the architecture of the Chainlink Automation Network. The Chainlink Automation Registry governs the actors on the network and compensates Automation Nodes for performing successful upkeeps. Developers can register their Upkeeps, and Node Operators can register as Automation Nodes.

## How it works

Automation Nodes follow a turn-taking algorithm to service upkeeps. A turn is a number of blocks and you can find the block count per turn for your network in the [configuration](/chainlink-automation/supported-networks/#configurations) section. During a turn a Upkeeps on the registry are randomly split, ordered into buckets, and assigned to an Automation Node to service them. Even if an Automation Node goes down, the network has built-in redundancy and your Upkeep will be performed by the next Automation Node in line.

During every block, the Automation Node reviews all of the upkeeps in its bucket to determine which upkeeps are eligible. This check is done off-chain using a geth simulation. The Automation Node checks both the `checkUpkeep` and `performUpkeep` conditions independently using simulation. If both are true (eligible), and the upkeep is funded, the Automation Node proceeds to execute the transaction on-chain.

While only one Automation Node monitors an upkeep at any point during a turn, an upkeep can have multiple on-chain transaction executions per turn. This is accomplished with a buddy-system. After a transaction is confirmed, the next Automation Node in the line monitors the upkeep. After a new transaction is confirmed, the previous Automation Node steps in again to monitor the upkeep until the end of the turn or until another transaction confirmation is complete. This creates a system that is secure and highly available. If a node becomes faulty and executes a transaction that is not eligible, the next node does not execute a transaction, which breaks the process.

Chainlink Automation use the same transaction manager mechanism built and used by Chainlink Data Feeds. This creates a hyper-reliable automation service that can execute and confirm transactions even during intense gas spikes or on chains with significant reorgs. This mechanism has been in use in Chainlink Labs for multiple years, is battle hardened, and the team continuously improves on it.

## Internal monitoring

Internally, Chainlink Automation also uses its own monitoring and alerting mechanisms to maintain a health network and ensure developers get the reliability that they expect.

## Supported Networks and Cost
