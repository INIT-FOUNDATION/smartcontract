In this guide, you will learn how to use Chainlink Automation with Data Streams. Chainlink Automation will “listen” to log events triggering it to fetch and deliver Data Streams reports on-chain to settle trades on-chain.

There are currently two types of Automation triggers that can retrieve Data Streams to use on-chain:

- [**Log triggers**](/chainlink-automation/log-trigger): Automation will listen to a log emitted on-chain and parse the log data in combination with user’s upkeep code to retrieve Data Streams reports
- [**Custom logic triggers**](/chainlink-automation/register-upkeep): Automation will check every second whether the logic of the contract requires Data Streams report retrieval before carrying out the process

## Before you begin

Before you begin this implementation, make sure you have the following:

A [registered and funded upkeep](/chainlink-automation/register-upkeep-in-contract) which uses an [Automation-compatible contract](/chainlink-automation/compatible-contracts) that gives instructions to the Automation network. The upkeep completes the following tasks:

- Parse the trigger log's data and extract needed elements, such as market data and the timestamp.
- Optionally map protocol market data to the relevant Data Stream feedIDs
- Trigger the [`StreamsLookup`](/chainlink-automation/automation-interfaces) using the specifications [provided below](#code-example)
- Parse the fetched Data Streams signed reports
- Perform on-chain code to deliver report and execute the trade depending on the outcome

## Code example

The following code provides an example of how Chainlink Automation can be used with Data Streams using [log triggers](/chainlink-automation/log-trigger). Data Streams delivers signed reports that your upkeeps can verify and use for your applications.

Read the [Data Streams Getting Started](/data-streams/getting-started) guide to learn how to use this code example. You can also view the [parameters and specifications](/chainlink-automation/automation-interfaces#streamslookupcompatibleinterface) of the functions included within this sample.
