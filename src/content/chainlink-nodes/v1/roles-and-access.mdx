import { Aside } from "@components"

Chainlink Nodes allow the root admin CLI user and additional admin users to assign role-based access tiers. This approach grants specific access to multiple users without providing admin privileges to all users.

These new API users can log in to the Operator UI independently.

## Roles and access

Each user has a specific role assigned to their account. There are four roles: `admin`, `edit`, `run`, and `view`.

Specific actions are enabled to check role-based access before they execute. The following table lists the actions that have role-based access and the role that is required to run that action:

| Action                                        | View | Run | Edit | Admin |

## Configure users and roles

You can only use the CLI to configure role-based access.

### Prerequisites

Only admins can configure role-based access. Connect to the Chainlink node container and log in as an admin before you create, modify, or delete user roles for other accounts:

1. Open an interactive shell session on the container that is running your node:

   ```shell
   docker exec -it chainlink /bin/bash
   ```

1. Log into the Chainlink CLI:

   ```shell
   chainlink admin login
   ```

   The CLI prompts you for the admin credentials that you configured for your node.

<Aside type="note" title="Log out of the CLI after your changes">
    Log out of the CLI after your changes. This prevents users with access to the shell from executing admin commands.

    To log out from the shell session, run:

    ```shell
    chainlink admin logout
    ```

</Aside>

### View the current list of users

To view the current list of users, run the following command:

```shell
chainlink admin users list
```

### Create a new user with a specific role

For example, you can create a user with view-only permissions on the node with the following command:

```shell
chainlink admin users create --email=operator-ui-view-only@test.com --role=view
```

This user can now log into the UI and query the API, but cannot change any settings or jobs.

### Modify a user role and permissions

To modify permissions, run the `admin users chrole` command. Use the `-h` flag to get a complete list of options for these commands:

```shell
chainlink admin users chrole -h
```

### Delete a user role and permissions

To delete existing users, run the `admin users delete` command. Use the `-h` flag to get a complete list of options for these commands:

```shell
chainlink admin users delete -h
```
