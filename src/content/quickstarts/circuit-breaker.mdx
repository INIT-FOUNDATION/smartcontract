Circuit breakers are useful for pausing dApps and processes when adverse events are detected on-chain. These circuit breakers can prevent loss of assets during volatile market events, unstable network conditions, or if systems that your dApp relies on become compromised.

The example circuit breaker contract is a highly configurable proof of concept that can be used with [Data Feeds](/data-feeds). It is capable of emitting events or calling custom functions based on predefined conditions, and it comes with an interactive UI that allows users to easily configure and manage the contract.

## Objective

The [Circuit Breaker repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-circuitbreaker) contains example contracts of an implementation of a circuit breaker that can be used with any OCR price feed. It is possible to monitor a given contract, specify the price when the circuit breaker will be triggered based on predefined conditions, and then underlying logic of what happens when the circuit breaker is triggered.

## Before you begin

You can run this example on Linux, MacOS, or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

Before you start this tutorial, install the required tools:

- Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - Run `git --version` to check the installation. You should see an output similar to `git version x.x.x`.
- Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) 16.0.0 or higher
  - Run `node --version` to check the installation. You should see an output similar to `v16.x.x`.

## Setup the example

To set up this example, clone the source and install the required packages.

1. Clone the [smartcontractkit/quickstarts-circuitbreaker](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-circuitbreaker) repository, change directories, and install the dependencies using `npm`:

   ```shell
   https://github.com/smartcontractkit/circuit-breaker-chainlink-automation.git && \
   cd circuit-breaker-chainlink-automation && \
   npm i
   ```

1. Install the `chainlink/contracts` npm package:

   ```shell
   npm install @chainlink/contracts@0.6.1 --save
   ```

## Run the example

In this section, you will deploy two contracts and then set up Chainlink Automation.

### Deploy contracts

1. Deploy the `ExampleImplementation.sol` contract and enter the following input to the constructor:
   - The proxy contract address of the price feed (example: `0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43`)
   - The maxBalance (example: `3000000000000`)
   - The `isEmergencyPossible` flag - set this to `true` if you want the circuit breaking condition to be checked
1. Deploy the `CircuitBreaker.sol` contract.

### Register and fund an upkeep

Registering an upkeep on Chainlink Automation creates a smart contract that will run your circuit breaker contract.

1. Click **Register new Upkeep**.

1. Select the _Custom logic_ trigger.

1. For _Target contract address_, input the address of your deployed `CircuitBreaker.sol` contract.

1. Get the ABI from Remix.

1. In the Check Data field - pass in the address of the ExampleImplementation.sol contract. Note: Use abi.encode this contract address with a 0x in the beginning before entering it as checkData

1. Register and fund your upkeep.
