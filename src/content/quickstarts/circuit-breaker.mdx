title: "Data Feed Circuit Breaker Using Chainlink Automation"
---

Circuit breakers are useful for pausing dApps and processes when adverse events are detected on-chain. These circuit breakers can prevent loss of assets during volatile market events, unstable network conditions, or if systems that your dApp relies on become compromised.

The example circuit breaker contract is a highly configurable proof of concept that can be used with [Data Feeds](/data-feeds). It is capable of emitting events or calling custom functions based on predefined conditions, and it comes with an interactive UI that allows users to easily configure and manage the contract.

## Overview

This example uses HardHat and Ganache for development and testing.

## Before you begin

You can run this example on Linux, MacOS, or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

Before you start this tutorial, install the required tools:

- Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - Run `git --version` to check the installation. You should see an output similar to `git version x.x.x`.
- Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) 16.0.0 or higher
  - Run `node --version` to check the installation. You should see an output similar to `v16.x.x`.
- Create an account with [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) to use as an RPC endpoint if you do not already have one. Alternatively, you can [use your own testnet clients](/chainlink-nodes/resources/run-an-ethereum-client).

## Setup the example

To set up this example, clone the source, configure environment variables, and start the test UI.

1. Clone the [smartcontractkit/circuit-breaker-chainlink-automation](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/circuit-breaker-chainlink-automation.git) repository, change directories, and install the dependencies using `npm`:

   ```shell
   https://github.com/smartcontractkit/circuit-breaker-chainlink-automation.git && \
   cd circuit-breaker-chainlink-automation && \
   npm i
   ```

1. Configure an `.env` file with default settings.

   ```shell
   echo "NETWORK=hardhat" >> .env && \
   echo "LOCAL_RPC_URL=\"http://127.0.0.1:7545\"" >> .env
   ```

1. Add your RPC URL to the `.env` file. Replace `YOUR_RPC_URL` with the [RPC URL for your deployment network](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/config#json-rpc-based-networks). You can use an RPC node provider such as [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/). Alternative,

   ```shell
   echo "MAINNET_RPC_URL=\"YOUR_RPC_URL\"" >> .env
   ```

1. Deploy the testnet contract to your local Ganache testnet:

   ```shell
   make deploy
   ```

1. Change to the `./ui` directory and install the UI dependencies:

   ```shell
   cd ./ui && \
   npm i
   ```
