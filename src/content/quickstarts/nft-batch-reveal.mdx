## Objective

In this tutorial, you will use a demo user interface to learn how to use Chainlink Automation to automate batch reveal of NFT mints. The demo includes setting up a Chainlink VRF subscription, funding it, automatically generating a smart contract that will then be used by both VRF (as a consumer) and in Automation (as the target contract). VRF is used for randomizing the metadata for the NFTs and Automation is used to set trigger conditions for when the NFT metadata is revealed via batch size and/or time interval parameters

The demo includes setting up a Chainlink VRF subscription, funding it, automatically generating a smart contract that will then be used by both VRF (as a consumer) and in Automation (as the target contract). VRF is used for randomizing the metadata for the NFTs and Automation is used to set trigger conditions for when the NFT metadata is revealed via batch size and/or time interval parameters


## Objective 3

In this tutorial, you will use a demo user interface to learn how to use Chainlink Automation to automate batch reveal of NFT mints. The demo includes setting up a Chainlink VRF subscription, funding it, automatically generating a smart contract that will then be used by both VRF (as a consumer) and in Automation (as the target contract). VRF is used for randomizing the metadata for the NFTs and Automation is used to set trigger conditions for when the NFT metadata is revealed via batch size and/or time interval parameters

## Use case

You can use this to

- Automate an NFT batch reveal per your requirements of batch size and/or duration. When a batch reveal is triggered, a VRF call is made to randomise the metadata for the batch of tokens
- Optimise gas costs with batching an NFT mint reveal
- Generate a sample code that utilises VRF and Automation, which can then be customised as needed in your own application

## Before you begin

- You have a wallet set up
- You have the gas currency for the chain (example: ETH, Matic) in your wallet
- You have ERC-677 LINK in your wallet. [Faucet link if you need LINK](https://faucets.chain.link/)
- You have a basic understanding of how Chainlink VRF and Automation work
