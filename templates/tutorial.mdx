import { Aside } from "@components"

{/* Add a brief description of the tutorial that leads into the Overview section */}
This tutorial shows you how to build an example application.

{/* Add an overview description of the tutorial with significant conceptual information, architecture information, and descriptive diagrams. This section describes what the reader will build in the tutorial, what the completed tutorial demonstrates, and what uses cases might be enabled by adopting the technology behind the tutorial. */}

## Overview

You can use the components and code samples in this tutorial as a starting point for building your own applications.

{/* Optional - A prerequisites section with an unordered list of what you need before you begin the tutorial. */}

## Before you begin

Before you start this tutorial, complete the following items:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

{/* Heading names with ## <h2> style. If <h3> or <h4> are required for sub-sections, add more # characters. */}

## Setup steps

{/* A brief description of the components the user will set up in the tutorial. Include an unordered list with heading links to the sub-sections */}
This tutorial requires you to set up two primary components:

- [Component 1](#setup-sub-section-1)
- [Component 2](#setup-sub-section-1)

{/* Use sub-sections for major components of the tutorial. Usually multiple major components go into creating a tutorial. Separate each one into a different section if it makes sense. */}

### Setup sub-section 1

{/_
Optional - Use the <Aside> component to call extra attention to risks, warnings, or potential issues.
Available types are:
note
tip
caution
danger
_/}

<Aside type="note" title="Example notice">
  Example notice.
</Aside>

{/* Brief description of what components you are setting up and why it is necessary for the guide. */}
Run `./setup-example` to install the required config files.

{/* An ordered list of steps to run with example output and descriptions of each step where possible. */}

1. Run the `./setup-example` command.

   {/* Command to run for setting up */}

   ```shell
   ./setup-example
   ```

   This command prints the expected result.

   {/* Command output */}

   ```text
   Expected results
   ```

1. {/* Step 2 */}

   1. {/* Sub-step A */}
   1. {/* Sub-step B */}

1. {/* Step 3 */}

{/* Sub-section 2 - Add additional sub sections for each major component of the tutorial. */}

### Setup sub-section 2

{/* The section for running the tutorial and reaching the final result. */}

## Run steps

{/* Brief description for running or deploying the completed tutorial result. This section should be the final section of the tutorial instructions. */}
Run the example in a terminal. When you are done, you will have a complete running solution.

{/* An ordered list of steps to run with example output and descriptions of what is happening in each step. */}

1. Run the `./run-tutorial` command.

   {/* Command to run */}

   ```shell
   ./run-tutorial
   ```

   This command prints the expected result.

   {/* Command output */}

   ```text
   Expected result
   ```

1. {/* Step 2 */}

1. {/* Step 3 */}

{/* Optional - Include code examples and a description of how it works. If there are specific best practices or details that you want to call out, highlight them. */}

### Code example

The main part of this tutorial is the [`test.js` script](samples/productName/tutorialName/test.js).

{/* Add the code sample to the /public/samples folder and reference it using the CodeSample component. */}

<CodeSample src="samples/productName/tutorialName/test.js" />

{/* Describe the important parts of the code example and what they accomplish. */}
This example has the following components:

- `const test`: An example constant storing a string.
- `print()`: A function used to print `test` to the console.

## Summary (Optional)

{/* Add an optional summary leading into the What's Next links. */}
